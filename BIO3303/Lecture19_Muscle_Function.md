# Lecture 18: Introduction to Muscles

## Muscle Innervation
**Myogenic muscles:**	contraction generated by trigger from within the muscle. 
* Found in **cardiac** muscle.

**Neurogenic muscles:** stimulated to contract by neural activity. 
* **Skeletal** muscles innervated by motor neurons.

## Troponin-Tropomyosin Complex
**Tropomyosin:** Double stranded protein spanning ~7 actin monomers. Blocks myosin binding sites on actin.

**Troponin:** A 3-subunit complex.
* **TnC:** Calcium-binding sites
* **TnI:** binds actIn
* **TnT:** binds Tropomyosin

### Regulation of actino-myosin binding:
1) Calcium binds to TnC
2) TnI releases actin
3) Troponin-tropomyosin complex moves away from myosin-binding sites 
4) Myosin is free to bind to the actin

Muscles **actively shorten** and **passively lengthen**
