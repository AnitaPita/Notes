* **Acclimatization**: process of physiological change in response to naturally changing environmental conditions (reversible)
* **Acclimation**: process of physiological change in response to a controlled or manipulated environmental variable (under laboratory conditions) (reversible)
* **Polyphenism (developmental plasticity):** development under different conditions results in different adult phenotypes. E.g. Water fleas (Daphnia) (irreversible)
* **Reaction norm:** the range of phenotypes that can be produced by a given genotype when it is exposed to different environments
* **Adaptation:** change in the genetic structure of a population as a result of natural selection
* **Conformers:** allow internal conditions to change with variation in external conditions
* **Regulators:** maintain constant internal conditions regardless of the external conditions (e.g. homeostasis)
* **Negative feedback loops:** maintain parameters within optimal physiological range (homeostasis)
* **Homeostasis:** maintenance of a constant internal state (e.g. body T⁰ in mammals = 37⁰C); the animal maintains internal body conditions despite a changing external environment
* **Enantiostasis:** maintenance of function when physiological variables are changing (e.g. membrane fluidity at different temperatures); in a new environment, the animal’s internal conditions change but physiological function is maintained through alternate action

 
### Lecture 2

* **Endocrine Cell:** all glands that secrete hormones
* **Nervous System:** Electrical signals travel in neurons; Release chemicals (neurotransmitters) into space between neuron and target cell
* **Neurons:** release neurotransmitters into synapse to communicate directly with target (postsynaptic) cell
* **Soma:** cell body
* **Dendrites:** receive incoming signal that results in change in membrane potential
* **Axon hillock:** initiate action potentials
* **Axon:** can be myelinated or unmyelinated; 
* **Resting membrane potential:** ~-70mV; Concentration gradients maintained by Na+/K+ pumps to compensate for leaks
* **Ligand-gated channels:** open when ligands (neurotransmitter) bind
* **Presynaptic neuron:** transmits signal to postsynaptic neuron (receiving neuron)
* **Graded potential:** Activated by ligand- gated Na+ channel, cause changes in membrane potential; “synaptic potential”, spatially restricted, conduction with decrement; spatially and temporally summated to cause or prevent AP generation
* **Myelin sheath:** Schwann cells wrapped around axons; insulates to increase speed/efficiency of transmission
* **Nodes of Ranvier:** unmyelinated, has lots of VG Na+ channels

* **Ionotropic Receptor:** at a chemical synapse; ligand-gated channels; rapid changes in postsynaptic membrane potential
* **Metabotropic Receptor:** signaling cascade opens ion channels; Activates intracellular transduction pathway; Slower changes in postsynaptic membrane potential; Can also modify proteins and gene expression
* **Simple Neural Network:** Sensory information detected by receptor → Signal transmitted from sensory neuron → efferent neuron → effector organ (response)
* **Ancestral Neural Network:** receptor cell directly innervates an effector cell (little processing, no CNS)
* **Monosynaptic Neural Network:** sensory neuron synapses with efferent neuron (e.g. knee-jerk reflex)
* **Polysynaptic Neural Network:** at least one interneuron between sensory and efferent neuron (increases processing capacity)
* **Reflex Arc:** sensory neurons relay stimulus to giant interneuron at terminal ganglion; signals motor neuron
* **Convergence:** many afferent neurons synapse with one efferent neuron
* **Divergence:** one afferent neuron synapses with many efferent neurons; Allows a single signal to control many independent processes, and it is a way to amplify the signal
* **Habituation:** a decline in the tendency to respond to a stimulus due to repeated exposure; partial inactivation of voltage- gated Ca2+ channel in axon terminal of sensory neuron; simple learning; causes less transmitters to be released
* **Sensitization:** an increase in the response to a gentle stimulus after exposure to a strong stimulus; occurs via facilitating neurons

 
### Lecture 3

* **Primitive Nerve Net:** Found in radially symmetrical animals; unspecialized neurons w/ no obvious integration center
* **Ganglia:** Clusters of neuronal cell bodies, small independent integrating centres; first seen in more complex cnidarians
* **Connectives/Commissures:** Connections between ganglia for more rapid transmission (e.g. L/R coordination); Connected ganglia ultimately form longitudinal nerve cords; in segmented, bilaterall symmetrical animals
* **Cephalization:** Fusion of anterior ganglia in more complex animals; Sensory receptors abundant in head; Brain plays larger role in integration
* **Echinoderms:** radially symmetrical, descended from bilaterally symmetrical ancestor that likely had some cephalization (larvae = bilateral); exception in cephalization trend
* **Cephalopods:** large brain for intelligence; can learn, distinguish objects and patterns
* **Vertebrate Nerve:** Groups of axons from many neurons; Enclosed in successive layers  of connective tissues; most have mix of afferent and efferent neurons (mixed nerves); some purely one or other
* **CNS:** Brain + Spinal cord; encased in cartilage/bone; hollow nerve cord; hollow inside brain; bottom 1/3 of spine = cauda equinus
* **PNS:** nerves, sensors, effectors

### Lecture 4

* **SNS:** Flight-or-flight response
* **PSNS:** rest and digest
* **Basal tone:** organs receive inputs from both branches under resting condition
* **Neurotransmitters:** Synthesized in neurons, released @ presynaptic membrane after depolarization, bind to postsynaptic receptor and cause an effect
  *	**Classes:** AAs, Biogenic amines, Neuropeptides, Acetylcholine, “other”
* **Agonist:** a substance that binds to a receptor and initiates a signaling event (may include both the natural endogenous ligand as well as pharmaceutical agents that mimic the natural substance).
* **Antagonist:** a substance that binds to a receptor but does not stimulate a signaling event. Interfere with the binding of the natural ligand.
* **Tunica Media:** composed of smooth muscle
* **Baroreceptor Reflex:** caused by increase in mean arterial pressure; controlled by negative feedback; decreases sympathetic output
* **Evolution of ANS:** lower vertebrates relied more on circulating catecholamines (NE/E); no sympathetic innervation
* **Chromaffin Cells:** modified postganglionic neurons in adrenal medulla (modified sympathetic ganglion); secrete epinephrine/norepinephrine into circulation directly

 
### Lecture 5

* **Endocrinology:** study of chemical messengers and the tissues or glands from which they are secreted
  * The endocrine system includes all the endocrine cells and tissues which produce hormones.
* **Hormone:** a chemical messenger secreted from a neuronal (neurosecretory) or non-neuronal cell that acts locally (paracrine) or at a distance from that cell.
* **Conservation of endocrine glands:** organisms produce similar hormones but diff responses (e.g. thyroid hormone into tadpole = metamorphosis)

 
### Lecture 6

* **Additive Effects:** effect is equal to the sum of effects of each hormone alone (e.g. glucagon + Epinephrine)
* **Synergistic Effects:** effect greater than the sum of effects of each hormone alone (e.g. glucagon + epinephrine + cortisol)
* **Rathke’s pouch:** separates during development, pouch filled with proliferating cells; gives rise to anterior pituitary
* **Neurohaemal organ:** specialized structure in which neurons contact blood vessels (e.g. Median eminence; posterior pituitary)
* **Posterior Pituitary Hormones:**
  1. Oxytocin: made of 9aas, causes uterine contraction and milk let-down
  2. Arginine Vasopressin (AVP/ADH): 9aas, regulates water absorption in kidneys
* **Anterior Pituitary Hormones (Tropic):**
  1. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): Regulates cortisol secretion from adrenal cortex
  2. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): Regulates secretion of iodothyronines in thyroid gland
  3. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): Regulates gametogenesis in gonads
  4. Luteinizing hormone (LH): Regulates steroidogenesis in gonads
  5. Growth hormone: Regulates somatomedins (IGF) secretion from liver; regulated by GHRH+GHIH; tumour in somatotrope -> Excessive GH prod -> excessive growth
* **Anterior Pituitary Hormones (Non-tropic):**
  1. Growth hormone (GH): Regulates growth and metabolism in a variety of tissues; peptide
  2. Prolactin (PRL): Milk synthesis in mammary gland; Salt/water balance at kidneys and gills in fish
* **Goiter:** synthesis of TH compromised (iodine), leading to decrease in TH plasma levels (hypothyroidism); Releases –ve feedback, ↑TRH and TSH levels, overstimulation of thyroid
* **Intermediate lobe of Pituitary:** Makes Melanocyte Stimulating hormone (MSH) which causes skin darkening in fish/amphibians/reptiles; chromatophores; small in adult humans
 
### Lecture 7

* **Stress:** Condition in which dynamic equilibrium of an organism is threatened or disturbed because of intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli (“Stressors”) (e.g. food/water shortage, fire, storm, predators, parasites, social conflict, temp, pollutants)
* **Acute stress (short term):** stress response, adaptation that allows an animal to respond immediately in a generalized way to a threatening situation; physiological responses ensure survival in an acute crisis; adaptive b/c increases survival and fitness
* **Chronic stress (long term):** physiological responses that are adaptive in the short term become damaging in the long term; maladaptive b/c decreases reproduction, survival, and fitness
* **Permissiveness:** presence of one hormone is required for the other to exert an effect (e.g. cortisol enhances the effects of NE and E to cause constriction of blood vessels)
* **HSP (heat shock protein):** promotes proper folding of protein; can’t enter nucleus on its own, needs to bind with cortisol to become activated
