# Lecture 3: Nervous System Diversity and Organization

## NS Evolution

**Primitive Nerve Net:** Found in radially symmetrical animals; unspecialized neurons w/ no obvious integration center. Impulse radiates in every direction.

**Ganglia:** Clusters of neuronal cell bodies, small independent integrating centres; first seen in more complex cnidarians

**Connectives/Commissures:** Connections between ganglia for more rapid transmission (e.g. L/R coordination)
* Connected ganglia ultimately form longitudinal *nerve cords*
* found in segmented, bilaterally symmetrical animals

**Cephalization:** Fusion of anterior ganglia in more complex animals
* Sensory receptors abundant in head
* Brain plays larger role in integration

**Echinoderms:** radially symmetrical, descended from bilaterally symmetrical ancestor that likely had some cephalization 
* larvae = bilateral
* are an exception in the cephalization trend

**Cephalopods:** large brain for intelligence; can learn, distinguish objects and patterns

## Vertebrate NS Organization: CNS vs PNS

**Vertebrate Nerve:** Groups of axons from many neurons; Enclosed in successive layers  of connective tissues
* most have mix of afferent and efferent neurons (mixed nerves), but some have purely one or other
* **Nerves:** bundles of cells with neurons working together

**CNS:** Brain + Spinal cord, encased in cartilage/bone
* hollow nerve cord and hollow inside brain
* bottom 1/3 of spine = **cauda equinus**

**PNS:** nerves, sensors, effectors

**White Matter:** myelinated axons
**Grey Matter:** cell bodies and dendrites
**Dorsal Horns/Roots:** afferent (cell bodies outside)
**Ventral Horns/Roots:** efferent (cell bodies inside)
* Horns are within the spine; roots come out of the spine.
* Ascending tracts = sensory, descending tracts = motor.

**Meninges:** three protectice layers on the CNS.

**Cerebrospinal Fluid:** brain and spinal cord float in here; acts as a shock absorber

**Blood-brain barrier:** tight-junctions btw endothelial cells lining  brain capillaries
* prevents molecules from leaking into CNS
* More permeable in  some areas (e.g for  hormones secretion): Regions around pineal and pituitary glands, parts of hypothalamus.

### Supporting Glial Cells
\# of Glial cells > # of neurons
* **Oligodendrocyte:** conduction speed  (myelin sheath) in *CNS*
* **Schwann cells:** conduction speed, regeneration and regrowth of neurons (in *PNS*)
* **Astrocytes:** transport of nutrients and debris
* **Microglia:** maintenance; remove debris and dead cells
* **Ependymal Cells:** line fluid-filled cavities, often have cilia to circulate CSF

## Brain Evolution and Topography
**Neurotrophins:** factors secreted by neurons that affect the survival and differentiation of neurons during development (e.g. Nerve  growth factor (NGF)) A (-)NGF environment has no connections between neurons.
* **Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF): support survival and re-growth of existing neurons. 

### Regions of Vertebrate Brain
1) **Hindbrain:** Medulla, pons, and cerebellum
   * Control respiration, Cardiovascular, gastric functions, and very basic functions in general.
2) **Midbrain (Mesencephalon):** Coordination of visual, auditory and sensory info 
   * in mammals, main fnct = connect forebrain with hindbrain
3) **Forebrain (Diencephalon + Telencephalon):** 
   * **Thalamus:** integrate and relay sensory info to cortex (acts as  a filter, i.e. hearing your name at a party)
   * **Hypothalamus/Pituitary:** homeostatic regulation, autonomic regulation, hormone cascades, emotion control
   * **Cerebral Cortex (Telencephalon):** Complex information integration

### Evolution of the CNS
Conservation of structure and function.
* Mammals: greatly reduced midbrain, large forebrain
* Birds and fish: large midbrain and cerebellum (interpretation of sensory signal and coordination of movements)

How "smart" is a group of animals? It depends on the brain weight.
* As a trend, mammals have a larger brain weight per body weight and have more neurons; can infer intelligence from a brain-body-mass graph.

### Human Brain Function
**Cerebrum (cerebral cortex):** processing of information; is GRAY matter; 6 layers, functionally distinct.
* **Left brain:** controls speech
* **Right brain:** Perception and spatial relationships.
* **Corpus callosum:** Connects the left and right brains.

**Split-brain Syndrome:** Severing the corpus callosum results in different perceptions if a figure is shown in the left or right visual field.
* If someone picks up a key with their left hand, they will know what it is but they just cannot speak the object.
* If they see a ring in the right field of view, they will not be able to understand what the object is unless there's an object description attached to it.

**Cortical Folding:** Increases surface area, functional complexity of forebrain  (correlates with intelligence)
* **Sulcus:** groove
* **Gyrus:** Fold

**Lobes:**
* **Frontal:** reasoning, planning,  speech
* **Parietal:** recognition,  orientation, sensory
* **Temporal:** auditory  processing, memory, speech
* **Occipital:** visual processing
* The cortical areas are specific areas that correspond to particular functions.

**Sensory homunculus:** Areas of somatosensory cortex that are devoted to various body parts are disproportionate.
* Scaled to represent size of  cortical area devoted to  sensory reception
* Size of cortical region  reflects the # of sensory  neurons present in a  particular body part
* High density of sensory neurons = high *discrimination*; High density of motor neurons = high *dexterity*

## PNS Subdivisions: Somatic vs Autonomic

CNS and PNS communicate extensively; CNS receives sensory inputs from PNS and sends efferent signals to:
* **Somatic system:** controls body movement
* **Autonomic system:** regulates internal functions

* **Cranial Nerves:** 13 pairs (0, being the terminal nerve, to 12)
* **Spinal Nerves:** 31 pairs (8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 6 lumbar, 5 sacral + coccygeal nerve

## Somatic motor branch and the NMJ
Usually under conscious control.

**Motor neurons:** innervate skeletal muscles
* Longest in the body; Induce contraction and relaxation patterns for different movements (antagonistic muscle)

**Acetylcholine:** Neurotransmitter found at the **neuromuscular junction**
* Is glutamate in many invertebrates
* The effect is *always excitatory*

**NMJ:**
1) Action potential results in ACh release
   * VG Ca2+ channels open and increase [Ca2+] leading to vesicle docking
2) Binds nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) on skeletal muscle
   * nAChRs = ligand-gated ion channels; ions (mostly Na+) depolarize the muscle
3) Induces muscle contraction

**Autonomic Branch of PNS:** Not usually under conscious control (involuntary)
* **Effectors:** Cardiac Muscles, smooth muscles, Glands, and organs
* Consists of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems that tightly regulate physiological systems (see next lecture)
