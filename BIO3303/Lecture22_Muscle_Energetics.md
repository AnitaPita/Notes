# Lecture 22: Muscle Energetics

* **Myofibers** expresses single myosin II isoform
* 1 fiber type per motor unit (e.g. Type I, type II motor unit)

* Muscle made up of myofibers of different fiber types
* Isoform switching can occur in response to physiological conditions, exercise, or temperature.

## Skeletal Muscle Energetics
Energy use by a muscle depends on:
1) Fibre Type
2) Length and Intensity of Activity
3) Fuel Reserves available

ATP is important in muscle contraction for:
1) Ca2+ cycling (Ca2+-ATPase accounts for 25-30% of ATP use)
2) Crossbridge cycle (myosin ATPase) – power and detachment
3) Na+,K+-ATPase (recovery from muscle AP)

ATP Hydrolysis:
* muscle ATP stores are small; 5 mmol L^-1 is exhausted within about 10 twitches
* Can increase 20-fold to several hundred-fold with activity

**Sources of ATP:**
1) Phosphagen Pools 
   * ATP, ADP
   * Creatine phosphate (or arginine phosphate in invertebrates or some other animals)
   * **Creatine Phosphate (CrP)** = ATP stores in sarcoplasm
      * CrP + ADP = Cr + ATP
      * **function:** maintaining constant ATP levels (buffer) and instantaneous supply of ATP to myofibrils
      * Last only a very short period (few  seconds); when muscle is at rest, phosphocreatine pools are regenerated
      
2) Anaerobic Respiration
   * 2-3 ATP per glucose produced (3 ATP per glycogen or 2 ATP per glucose)
   * **Glycogen** = intramuscular stores of glucose
   * **Glucose** = supplied from blood
   * High intensity exercise fueled almost entirely by glycogen
   * In absence of O2, pyruvate  converted to lactate
     * Accumulation of lactate = metabolic disturbances

3) Oxidative phosphorylation
   * Occurs in mitochondria; 36 or more ATP per fuel oxidized
   * Uses all 3 fuels to make ATP (Fatty acids, glucose, and amino acids)
   * **Benefit:** Can provide a constant supply of ATP at low rates, is only limited by O2 delivery to mitochondria

**Rates of ATP Production:**
* Anaerobic glycolysis =  fastest rate of ATP production
  * Can supply ATP quickly to  fuel high intensity exercise
* Oxidized Fatty acids and carbohydrates (CHOs) supply ATP at slower rates: fuel low intensity exercise

### Fuel Stores available for locomotion
* **Whole-body stores:** 
  * **CHO** stored as glycogen in liver and muscle
  * **Lipids** stored as TAGs (triacylglyceride) in adipose tissue
  * **Proteins** = functional tissue
* Intramuscular stores: **glycogen and TAG** only
  * readily available for fast ATP production
  * high intensity exercise is predominantly fueled by **muscle glycogen** (as opposed to liver glycogen)

### Energy Metabolism
* Creatine phosphate (CrP) available early on
* Glycolysis allows muscles to produce ATP very  quickly
  * There are *limited* stores of glycogen; less-efficient glycogen pathway runs out of fuel quickly (short duration)
* Oxidative phosphorylation has slower pathways but maintained activation

### Fuel Availability (70 kg human)
On-board fuels:
1) [ATP] = 3 – 6 µmol g-1
2) [CrP] = 10 – 30 µmol g-1
3) muscle [glycogen] = 60 – 120 µmol g-1

Body stores:
1) Blood glucose = 8-10 g
2) Liver glycogen = 90 g (very labile i.e. easily alterable)
3) Adipose tissue triglycerides = 13.5 kg

### Fuel Usage
**Q1:** *What determines what fuel is used?* **Duration and Intensity of activity.**

**Respiratory Quotient value (RQ):** Indicates fuel utilization
* RQ = moles CO2/moles O2
  * CHO: RQ = 1
  * Fats: RQ = 0.7
  * Proteins: RQ = 0.8
  
**Q2:** *What mechanisms are responsible for mobilizing these fuels?*

1) Fat utilization -> hormone-sensitive lipase
   * Stimuli include: noradrenaline (from ANS), ↑growth hormone, ↑glucagon, ↓insulin, ↑exercise
   * Uses **cAMP pathway**
   * *Which fibers can use FFAs?* **Mitochondria-rich STO and FOG fibers.**

2) Carbohydrate utilization -> primarily glycogen
   * **Sources:** blood, liver, skeletal muscle
   * **Control:** glycogenolysis (Requires activation of *glycogen phosphorylase* which is rapid taking \<3s)
   * Conversion to glucose stimulated by noradrenaline and Ca2+
     * **Noradrenaline:** cAMP-dependent, in liver
     * **Ca2+:** Ca2+ from SR release during muscle contraction
     * Studies suggest that the *electrical and mechanical aspects* of contraction can be coupled to the *metabolic pathways* that power the contraction.

## Burst vs Endurance Exercise

### Burst Exercise 
High intensity exercise can only be maintained for short periods of time.
* **Fast-twitch (Type II) muscle fibers** are predominantly used
* Pathway for resting -> all-out effort:
  1) *Creatine phosphate* for a few seconds (very high rate of ATP production)
  2) *Anaerobic glycolysis* for a few minutes 
     * Intramuscular glycogen primarily used for faster ATP production
     * high rate of ATP production but lower than creatine phosphate
     * Exercise intensity decreases
  3) *Exhaustion* from energetic shortfalls, ion disturbances, pH imbalances, etc.

**Recovery from burst exercise:** 
1) Replenish energy stores: glycogen,  ATP, CrP
2) Re-establish ion gradients, Ca2+  stores, pH
3) lactate removal: 
   1) glycogen synthesis in muscle
   2) to liver for gluconeogenesis (Cori cycle)
   3) to heart or red muscles to be oxidized

**EPOC:** elevated postexercise oxygen consumption
* Energy for the above processes come from **oxidative phosphorylation**, so there is an *oxygen debt* which varies with intensity of exercise.

### Endurance Exercise
Low-intensity exercise can be maintained for long periods of time.
* **Slow-twitch (type I) muscle fibers** are predominantly used (mitochondria rich)
* ATP production comes from **oxidative phosphorylation**
  * Limited by rate of oxygen delivery to mitochondria:
    1) Many capillaries
    2) Small muscle fiber diameter
    3) High [myoglobin]
    4) Strong heart (↑ stroke volume)
  * Limited by rate of delivery and availability of fuels (fuel used depends on exercise intensity)
    * rate of ATP production from oxidized CHO > oxidized Fat
    * BUT quantitatively, stores of Fat > CHO

### Muscle Fatigue
**Muscle fatigue** = ↓ muscle tension with repeated stimulation
* **Short-duration, high-intensity exercise:**
  * Rapid onset and recovery
  * Results in elevated [H+] and [Pi], decreased Ca2+ release from SR
* **Low-intensity, long-duration exercise:**
  * Slow onset and recovery
  * Results in depletion of muscle glycogen, changes in activity of muscle proteins
* In both cases, associated with but not caused by depletion of muscle [ATP] -> protective mechanism
  * **Central command fatigue:** Lack of appropriate excitatory signals from cerebral cortex

## Case Study of Sandpipers: Long-distance migrants and Endurance Athletes

* The semi-palmated sandpiper spends summers in Arctic and winters in S.America. 
* They make a migratory flight which includes a 2-week stopover at Bay of Fundy prior to a 3-day, ~4500km trans-oceanic journey.
  * Here, birds re-fuel on mudshrimp *Corophium volutator* – very high in **Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids** (PUFAs)
* PUFA-rich diet results in:
  1) Increased MonoUFA stores (result = **↑ fuel efficiency**)
  2) Increased PUFA in membranes; associated with...
     1) improved **fatty acid mobilization**
     2) ↑ expression of enzymes for **aerobic metabolism**
     3) ↑ **mitochondrial density**
