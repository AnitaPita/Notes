# Lecture 12: Mechanoreception

**Mechanoreceptor Ion Channels:** There are two types that are stretch-activated with two attachment points: Extracellular matrix proteins and cytoskeleton.

1. **ENaCs** (Epithelial sodium channels)
2. **TRP** (transient receptor potential) **channels**

* Mechanical forces cause displacement of extracellular anchoring proteins resulting in conformational change
* There are NO intracellular cascades since mechanoreceptors are ion channels directly connected to the cytoskeleton
* Sensory Transduction is similar in inverts and vertebrates 
* **Location** and/or **peripheral filtering mechanisms** determine whether it is activated by sound, gravity, acceleration, or water currents

**TYPES OF MECHANORECEPTORS**

1. Touch and Pressure
  * Baroreceptors (vertebrates)
  * Tactile Receptors (vertebrates AND invertebrates)
  * Proprioceptors (vertebrates AND invertebrates)
  
2. Equilibrium and Hearing (both in invertebrates and vertebrates)
  * Statocysts
  * Hair Cell Neuromasts
  * Electroreceptors

## Touch and Pressure

### Baroreceptors (Vertebrate only)
Baroreceptors detect pressure changes in walls of blood vessels, parts of the heart, digestive, digestive, reprodutive, and urinary tracts
* E.g.: **Carotid Sinus baroreceptors** monitor blood pressure to the brain

### Tactile Receptors
Detect touch, pressure, and vibration on the body.
#### (Vertebrates)
**Tonic Receptor Cells:** Detect light touch and pressure on the skin surface
* **Free Nerve Ending:** Sensory neurons with dendrites interspersed among epidermal cells (there are receptor proteins on the dendrites)
* **Merkel's Disks:** Enlarged epidermal cell (Merkel Cells) associated with free nerve endings
  * Have a small receptive field (*fine* discrimination)

**Phasic Receptor Cells:** Detect movement or pressure on skin surface
* **Root hair plexus:** Nerve endings wrapped around base of hair follicles and respond when hair is displaced
  * Detect changes in movement across body surface
* **Pacinian Corpuscles:** Sensory dendrite surrounded by lamellae
  * Located in skin (deep), muscles, joints, and internal organs
  * Detect changes in **pressure**
  * Large receptive field, poor discrimination; especially sensitive to vibration

**Ruffini Corpuscle:** *Slowly-adapting tonic receptor* cells: dendrite endings with elongated capsule
* Location: connective tissue of skin and with connective tissue of joints and limbs
* Sensitive to: stretching of skin and mvt of joints
* help detect position of body in space (proprioceptor)

#### Invertebrates
They have cuticles, so how do they sense mechanical changes?

**Trichoid Sensilla:** Hair-like projection of cuticle; bends in response to touch or vibration
* An accessory structure transfers mvt of sensilla to dendrite of bipolar sensory neuron and opens stretch-sensitive TRP ion channels
* Very sensitive: detect small changes in air movements

**Campaniform Sensilla:** Similar to trichoid sensilla except they lack hair shaft; have **dome-shaped projection** of cuticle
* Found in clusters, especially near **joints of limbs**
* Function: Detect cuticle deformation as insect moves and allows for coordinated movement

### Proprioceptors
Tonic receptors (constant message to CNS); encode info about body position; 

1. Muscle spindle
  * Where: Surface of skeletal muscles
  * What: consist of *intrafusal fibers* (modified muscle fibers enclosed in connective tissue capsule)
  * Function: Monitor muscle length (AP firing rate is related to how far thespindle stretches)
2. Golgi Tendon Organs
  * Where: at junction between skeletal muscle and tendon
  * Function: Sense tendon tension
3. Joint Capsule Receptors
  * Where: capsules that enclose the joints
  * What: Many types similar to Pacinian corpuscles, Golgi tendon organs, free nerve endings, etc.
  * Function: Detect pressure, tension and mvt in joint

## Equilibrium and Hearing
Detects position of body relative to the force of gravity.
* Vertebrates: **ear** involved in equilibrium and hearing
* Invertebrates: Equilibrium organs are **separate** from hearing organs

### Statocysts (Invertebrates)
Statocysts are hollow, fluid-filled cavities lined with ciliated mechanosensory neurons
* **Statoliths:** dense particles of calcium carbonate within statocysts
  * Change in body orientation disturbs statoliths and their motion stimulates receptor proteins on cilia
* **In Cephalopods:** complex, paired statocyst system
  * **Cristae:** detect angular acceleration (turning)
  * **Macula:** detect linear acceleration (forward motion)
  * Macula and 3 cristae contain statoliths and mechanosensitive neurons
  * This system is similar to the **vertebrate vestibular system**.

### Hair Cells (Vertebrates)
Hair cells are **epithelial sensory receptor cells**
* They synapse with an afferent neuron
* Transduce mechanical stimulus into electrical signal
* Distributed in different sensory organs serving diverse functions
* 1 long **kinocilium** (absent in mammals). Many **stereocilia** in a tight bundle that contain few actin filaments at the base (**flexible**)
* **Tip Links:** small fibers that link stereocilia together. Connected to ion channels via *elastic proteins* (springs)
  * Pull open channel or push it closed 

**Vertebrate Hair cells**
* Mechanoreceptor proteins are located on the tips of the stereocilia 
* **TRP channels** are found here; 15% are open at rest (membrane potential = -60mv)
* **[K+]** *around* the hair cell is high, and enters when the channel is open
* **At rest:** membrane partially depolarized: some VG Ca2+ channels are open and cause the release of small amounts of Nt
* **Bending** causes tip links to pull (open) or push (close) channels, leading to depolarizing or hyperpolarizing graded receptor potentials; this directly affects opening of VG Ca2+ channels and NT release
* **Push** = stereocilia pivot away from kinocilium; Fewer APs sent
* **Pull** = stereocilia pivot towards the kinocilium; Number of APs increases
* APs encode *magnitude* and *direction* of mechanical stimulus (movement)

**Neuromast Organ**: structure consisting of a cup (**cupula**) filled with a viscous gel and hair cells
* SPECIES: fish and aquatic amphibians
* Gel within the cupula shifts, causing stereocilia to bend
* Isolated on skin or grouped
* **Lateral line system:** neuromasts organized in pits (ampullae) or in line running length of body; it allows fish to detect water mvt (flow directions, pressure, vibrations)

## Electroreception

**Electroreceptors:** modified hair cells similar to neuromasts
**Passive electrolocation:** passive detection of fields (flow, animal muscle or nerve activity)
**Active electrolocation:** detect and produce fields (electric organ produces a field, electroreceptors detect perturbations in the field)

## Vertebrate Inner Ear
**Hair cells** are the main receptors
**Components of the mammalian ear:**
* Outer ear: Pinna and auditory canal
* Middle ear: Ossicles (bones)
* Inner ear: **Vestibular apparatus** (equilibrium) and **cochlea** (hearing)

**Vestibular apparatus:** 3 semicircular canals (with swollen regions: **ampullae**); 2 sac-like swellings: **utricle**
and **saccule** (vestibular sacs)

**Otoliths:** mineralized particles suspended in gelatinous matrix above membrane called **macula**
* Macula contains large number of hair cells (>100,000)
* Physical movements induce: displacement of otoliths, which pulls on gelatinous mass and causes deformation of hair cells
* **Utricle macula:** oriented horizontally; detects motion in the *horizontal* plane
* **Saccule macula:** oriented vertically; detects motion in the vertical plane

**Utricle Responses**
* Macula oriented on horizontal plane
* **At rest** (or during constant motion): cells partially depolarized
* **Forward acceleration:** Stereocilia bend towards longest stereocilium, depolarization of hair cells, increasing firing rate of AP
* **Backwards acceleration or head tilt forward:** Stereocilia bend in opposite direction, hyperpolarization and decreases firing rate of AP

**Ampulla Organization**
* Ampulla = sac at the terminal ends of the semicircular canal, performs transduction in semicircular canals
* **Endolymph**: high [K+] fluid; flows during movements in particular directions
* NO otoliths
* **Cristae:** hair cells embedded in gelatinous mass called the **cupula**
* Similar in structure and function to neuromasts:
  * hair cells embedded in gelatinous mass called a cupula
  * Drag on gelatinous mass caused by movement of surrounding liquid causes bending of stereocilia and graded receptor potentials
* Ampulla responses:
  * **At rest:** hair cells partially depolarized
  * **With movement of head:** fluid in canals moves and causes stereocilia to pivot
    * Endolymph pushes stereocilia towards kinocilium: Depolarization (increase in firing of APs)
    * Endolymph pushes stereocilia away from kinocilium: Hyperpolarization (decrease in firing of APs)

### Hearing in fish

They have no outer ear, or canal connecting inner ear to the outside
* Fish body have roughly same density as water so sound waves pass through
* Otoliths	are much denser than water and the fish's body so they move more slowly in response to sound waves than does the rest of the fish
* Difference between mvt of fish body and otoliths causes stereocilia of hair cells to move
* **Otophysic Connections:**
  * **Weberian ossicles:** series of bones connecting swim bladder to the inner ear (e.g. goldfish can hear up to 4kHz)
  * **Gas ducts** ending in “bullae” extending from swim bladder to inner ear (e.g. American Shad (cupleid) can detect ultrasonic frequencies up to 180kHz)

### Mammalian Inner Ear

The inner ear is very sensitive to changes in freq. (vibrations/sec) and to loudness (amplitude of vibrations)
**Cochlea:** transmits vibrations from the **Oval window** (via the stapes) to the **round window**
* Causes waves of pressure differences in fluid of vestibular duct (perilymph)
* Waves travel to round window and cause vibrations of **basilar membrane**
* Hair cells embedded in basilar membrane move relative to the **stationary tectorial membrane** 

**Organ of Corti**
* Organ of Corti has thousands of hair cells (mammals have no kinocilium); Stereocilia in contact with tectorial membrane 
* Organized into **4** rows of hair cells:
  * 1 inner hair cell row: detection, transduction and encoding of sound features
  * 3 outer hair cell rows: receive efferent innervation, involved in amplification
* **Hair cell deflection:**
  1. When the basilar membrane vibrates it changes the position of the hair cells relative to the unmoving tectorial membrane
  2. Membrane moves up and down as pressure differences are transmitted through the scala vestibuli and scala tympani
  3. Causes mvt of the stereocilia; causes opening and closing of stretch activated ion channels
  4. Results in graded receptor potential
* **Place coding:**
  * Basilar membrane is not uniform along its length
  * widens from oval window to helicotrema; Basal end is narrow and more stiff; Apical end is wider and more floppy
  * different areas vibrate in response to sounds of different frequency
  * **Lower frequency sounds:** Vibrate distal (apical) end of basilar membrane
  * **Higher frequency sounds:** Vibrate basal end of basilar membrane
  * Specific populations of hair cells respond to specific sound frequencies
  * Neurons from each part of basilar membrane synapse with neurons leading to specific areas of auditory cortex (frequencies spatially mapped on basilar membrane and auditory cortex)
  
### Echolocation in Terrestrial Vertebrates
* **Terrestrial echolocators:** Bats, shrews, some cave-dwelling birds
* Function of echolocation: navigation, prey capture 
* Most species emit ultrasonic (high freq.) cries, reflected off objects in environment, 
  * High energy (potentially deafening) sound pulses (e.g. little brown bat cries = 120dB)
* **Protection against cries:** inner ear is mechanically isolated from the rest of the skull
  * Auditory sensitivity *decreased* during a cry by contraction of **tensor tympani muscles**

### Processing of Mechanosensory Information
Touch information from a variety of mechanosensitive neurons project to **somatosensory cortex**
* Topographic arrangement like in gustotopic map; adjacent areas on body surface represented in adjacent cortical regions
* Some areas are over-represented (sensitive, fine discrimination)
* Vestibular information projects to **cerebellum** and **cortex**
  * Vestibular nerve (one branch of **vestibulocochlear nerve; CN VIII**)
  * Processes balance, orientation and movement coordination
