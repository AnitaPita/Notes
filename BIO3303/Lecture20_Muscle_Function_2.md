# Lecture 20: Muscle Function (Continued)

### Cardiac Muscle Structural Characteristics
* Striated
* Branched
* Mononucleated
* Joined end-to-end

**Intercalated Disks:** contact points between cardiomyocytes

**Gap Junctions:** all cells contract almost all at once

### SA Node (Pacemaker) 
The SA node's activity sets heart rate. Spread of depolarization steps:
1) depolarization spreads via internodal pathways to AV node
2) Depolarization spreads through atria via gap junctions
3) Atria contract
4) Depolarization spreads through the bundles of His and Purkinje fibers then upward cell to cell via gap junctions
5) Ventricle contracts

**Myogenic:** do not need neural input to initiate contraction

**Pacemaker cells** have:
* Unstable resting membrane potential, slow depolarization to threshold
* Na+ leak (Funny) channels result in gradual depolarization
* ~100 depolarizations/min
