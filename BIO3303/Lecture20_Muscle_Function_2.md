# Lecture 20: Muscle Function (Continued)

### Cardiac Muscle Structural Characteristics
* Striated
* Branched
* Mononucleated
* Joined end-to-end

**Intercalated Disks:** contact points between cardiomyocytes

**Gap Junctions:** all cells contract almost all at once

### SA Node (Pacemaker) 
The SA node's activity sets heart rate. Spread of depolarization steps:
1) depolarization spreads via internodal pathways to AV node
2) Depolarization spreads through atria via gap junctions
3) Atria contract
4) Depolarization spreads through the bundles of His and Purkinje fibers then upward cell to cell via gap junctions
5) Ventricle contracts

**Myogenic:** do not need neural input to initiate contraction

**Pacemaker cells** have:
* Unstable resting membrane potential, slow depolarization to threshold
* Na+ leak (Funny) channels result in gradual depolarization
* ~100 depolarizations/min

## Autonomic Nervous System Effects on Heart Rate (Pacemaker Cells)
**Catecholamines:** sympathetic, *increase* HR (e.g. epinephrine, norepinephrine)
* OPEN funny and Ca2+ channels
* Faster depolarization to threshold
* Receptor = **Beta-1 nicotinic receptors**

**Acetylcholine:** parasympathetic, *decrease* HR
* CLOSE Ca2+ channels, OPEN K+ channels
* Slower depolarization to threshold (*hyperpolarizing K+ current*)

### Effects of Sympathetic Nervous System on Ventricular Contractility
Force and speed are regulated by **Norepinephrine and epinephrine**
1) NE and E activates G-protein, AC
2) cAMP ↑
3) Activates PK
4) PK phosphorylates:
   * DHPR and RyR: ↑Ca2+ influx
   * SERCA: ↑ Ca2+ reuptake → ↑ relaxation rate
   * Myosin: ↑ rate of myosin ATPase → ↑ rate of cross-bridge cycling, speed of contraction
   
## Muscle Types: A Review
Myocytes of different muscle types display special features to ensure proper functioning

1) Striated:
   * **Skeletal muscle:** neurogenic
     * Message comes from CNS via motor neurons
     * Regulated by the somatic nervous system
   * **Cardiac muscle:** myogenic
     * Message transmitted via ap junctions of intercalated discs
     * Regulated by the autonomic nervous system
2) Smooth:
   * Regulated by autonomic nervous system, hormones, and mechanical stretch
   * *Single-unit* = myogenic, with gap junctions
   * *Multi-unit* = neurogenic, with *few* gap junctions
   
## Smooth Muscle Organization
Smooth muscles are organized around hollow organs and tubes (digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and reproductive systems) 
* Small, spindle shaped cells, 2-10um in diameter, mononucleate
* Thin filaments and thick filaments arranged in complex networks throughout myocytes
* **No** sarcomeres
* Contract in **all** dimensions
* Thin filaments are anchored to plasma membrane (**adhesion plaques**) and to microfilaments (**dense body**)
* greater thin : thick filament ratio than striated muscles (i.e. more thick filaments)

## Smooth Muscle Contraction
Smooth muscles have **no** T-tubules and have sparse sarcoplasmic reticulum, so it has a slower excitation at Ca2+ delivery.
* Also, **no** troponin: Ca2+ regulation by **calmodulin-caldesmon complex**
* Contraction/relaxation slower than in skeletal muscles also because myosin ATPase activity 10-100x lower
  * e.g. Gut smooth muscle contraction takes 0.1-30s vs soleus muscle takes 0.07s
  * *However,* smooth muscles are therefore capable of sustained contractions without fatigue

## Smooth Muscle EC Coupling
* Ca2+ influx primarily comes from ECF but some also comes from SR
* Activation of myosin and actin regulated by independent pathways

### Actin-Based Regulation
**Caldesmon:** protein that binds actin to prevent formation of cross-bridges (similar to the tropomyosin in the troponin-tropomyosin complex)
* Ca2+  binds to calmodulin (CaM) 
* Ca2+ -CaM binds to caldesmon
* Ca2+ -CaM-caldesmon complex dissociates from actin
* myosin head can bind to actin
* When [Ca2+ ] ↓, the CaM-caldesmon complex dissociates and caldesmon binds actin, stopping actino-myosin binding

### Myosin-Based Regulation
Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) by **MLCK (kinase) and MLCP (phosphorylase)**
* Ca2+ binds to calmodulin
* This complex activates a kinase (MLCK) that phosphorylates the myosin light chain (MLC) 
* Permits contraction

## Control of Smooth muscle contraction
Many factors can influence contraction either directly or by modulating the intracellular [Ca2+]. This includes hormones, temperature, paracrine messengers, local chemical agents etc.
* Smooth muscles can form **latch cross-bridges:** myosin remains attached to actin long after Ca2+ ions are gone.
  * tension can be maintained without using ATP 
  * allows long contractions e.g. sphincters

**Innervation by ANS**
* **Varicosities:** contain vesicles of neurotransmitter released at numerous points
* Receptors for these NTs are spread diffusely over muscle cells
* The NTs can be either excitatory or inhibitory

## Smooth Muscle Types: Single/Multi-unit or Phasic/Tonic
**Single unit smooth muscle**
* **Where:** walls of gastrointestinal tract and small diameter blood vessels
* Many gap junctions so entire muscle contracts as a unit
* Myogenic; stretch activation may occur
* **Activity can be regulated by:** hormonal and neural input

**Multi-unit smooth muscle**
* **Where:** walls of airways and large blood vessels
* Each cell contracts *independently* (few or no gap junctions)
* Extensive ANS innervations (neurogenic)
* **Can be activated by:** by hormones (no stretch activation or myogenic activity)

**Phasic smooth muscles:** Muscles turn on and off together
* E.g. digestive tract moving boluses of food
* A *single-unit* smooth muscle is often this type; to coordinate with adjacent muscles, you want to pass a signal quickly

**Tonic smooth muscles:** Muscles are active most of the time
* E.g. sphincter
* a *multi-unit* smooth muscle is often this type; if you are always contracted it doesn’t really matter if you are connected to your neighbours.
