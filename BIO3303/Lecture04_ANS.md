# Lecture 4: Autonomic Nervous System

## Divisions of the ANS

**Autonomic Branch of PNS:** Not usually under conscious control (involuntary)
* **Effectors:** Cardiac Muscles, smooth muscles, Glands, and organs
* Consists of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems that tightly regulate physiological systems

**Enteric Branch of ANS:** Entirely concerned with digestion
* Innervates gastrointestinal tract,  pancreas, and gallbladder
* Operates independently of the other two branches, *but* the sympathetic/parasympathetic branches can regulate its activity

### Functional Differences between SNS and PSNS
The SNS and PSNS maintain Homeostasis by...
1) **Dual Innervation:** all muscles, organs, and systems in both systems can act on everything
2) **Antagonistic Action:** the systems generally do opposite actions
   * **Heart:** SNS Increases HR, PSNS decreases HR
   * **Bronchioles:** SNS dilates, PSNS constricts
   * **GI tract:** SNS decreases motility, PSNS increases motility
   * **Arrector pili muscles of skin:** SNS contracts, PSNS has no effect
3) **Basal tone:** At all times, both systems have a little bit of a feed going in (sending constant baseline system to everything it has control over); organs receive inputs from both branches under resting condition

* **Sympathetic:** Dominates during stress and physical activity ("fight-or-flight")
* **Parasympathetic:** Dominates at rest; regulates digestion and maintains function ("rest-and-digest")
* Homeostasis is a *dynamic* balance between the autonomic branches

### Organizational Differences between SNS and PSNS
Afferent side of ANS: visceral sensory receptors, *one* neuron in

**Efferent side:** 2 neurons in series
* **Preganglionic and postganglionic neurons:** synapse at Peripheral autonomic **ganglion** (in PNS)
* **Preganglionic:** cell body in CNS, terminates in the Peripheral autonomic ganglion
* **Postganglionic:** cell body in peripheral autonomic ganglion, terminates at the effector organ

**Structural Differences**
1) Location of cell bodies of preganglionic neuron in spinal cord
2) Location of ganglia (neuron length)
3) Number of connections (synapses)made by preganglionic neuron

### Neurotransmitters/Receptors
To be a neurotransmitter:
1) Synthesized in neurons
2) Released at presynaptic membrane following  depolarization
3) Bind to a postsynaptic  receptor and cause a  detectable effect
* Effect depends on the type of receptor
* **5 classes:** Amino acids, Biogenic amines, Neuropeptides, Acetylcholine, or "other".

* **Acetylcholine:** binds to either nicotinic (excitatory response) or muscarinic (excitatory or inhibitory) receptors
  * Binds **nicotinic** receptors at the preganglionic synapse in BOTH SNS and PSNS
  * Binds **muscarinic** receptors at the postganglionic synapse in PSNS
* **Norepinephrine/Epinephrine:** binds to alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors (metabotropic)
  * Binds **adrenergic** receptors at the postganglionic synapse in SNS

## Nicotonic and Muscarinic Cholinergic Synapse (ACh)
**Nicotinic AChR:** Ligand-gated, Ionotropic, rapid, ALWAYS excitatory (graded Excitatory postsynaptic potential)
* WHERE: NMJs, ganglionic synapses
1) ACh bind ligand binding-sites →  conformational change
2) Allows Na+ flow through (K+ also but  driving force of Na+ influx is higher)
3) Depolarize membrane (effector cell)
* **Structure:** Five subunits surround pore; A variety of combinations with different properties; they're different all over body

**Muscarinic AChR:** Metabotropic, slow, diverse effects (either EPSP or IPSP)
* Excite the gut/bronchioles, Inhibit the heart, blood vessels (vasoconstriction occurs)
* WHERE: Postganglionic	parasympathetic synapses
1) Ligand (ACh) binds receptor and conformational change activates G-protein
2) **G-protein:** heterotrimer activated by GTP to α-subunit, α-subunit and βγ-complex interact to activate ion channels
3) Leads to opening of ion channels and other intracellular events

## Adrenergic Receptors
* WHERE: sympathetic synapses at effector tissue
* Respond to: norepinephrine (NE) or epinephrine (E) released from sympathetic postganglionic neuron
* Different receptor types and subtypes (Tissue specific distribution; α adrenoreceptors (α1, α2 ARs); β adrenoreceptors (β1, β2 ARs)

* **Agonist:** a substance that binds to a receptor and initiates a signalling event 
  * may include both the natural endogenous ligand as well as pharmaceutical agents  that mimic the natural substance).
* **Antagonist:** a substance that binds to a receptor but does not stimulate a signaling event. 
  * *Interferes* with the binding of the natural ligand.

**Differences between α1, α2, β1, and β2 adrenergic receptors**

## Agonists and Antagonists: Receptor Pharmacology

**Nicotinic AChR** (SNS or PSNS)
* Agonist: nicotine (variable effects: both a stimulant and a relaxant)
* Antagonist: curare (paralysis) or bungarotoxin (paralysis, suppression of breathing)

**Muscarinic AChR** (only PSNS)
* Agonist: muscarine (brochoconstriction, bradycardia)
* Antagonist: atropine (increase heart rate)

**Adrenergic AChR** (only SNS)
* Agonist:
  * α or β: isoproterenol (treatment of bradycardia since it increases heart rate)
  * On β2 specifically: salbutamol (treatment of asthma since it does brochodilation)
* Antagonist: 
  * α: phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine (treatment of hypertension since it *prevents* vasocontriction)
  * β:propranolol, sotalol (treatment of anxiety or cardiac arrhythmias since it *prevents* increase in heart rate and brochodilation)

## Miscellaneous

### NE Biosynthesis
NE synthesized in axon terminals of postganglionic neurons; NE levels regulated.
* **Monoamine oxidase (MAO):** catalyzes breakdown
* **Cocaine:** inhibits re-uptake of NE and dopamine → propagates sympathetic response

### Regulation of ANS by the brain
**Hypothalamus** plays a dominant role
* initiates fight-or-flight response
* regulatory centers for body temperature, food  intake, and water  balance.

**Medulla oblongata:** Contains centres involved in the regulation of breathing, heart rate, and BP

### Sympathetic Stress Response
A stressor causes the sympathetic pathways to be activated, which can...
* Mobilize energy (glucose)
* Increase HR, breathing rate, redistribution of blood flow
* Promote	alert and responsive state

### Regulation of BP
Regulated by opposing action of sympathetic and parasympathetic branches
* Cardiovascular control center influences activity of ANS
* Cause adjustments in heart rate, stroke volume and vasoconstriction; blood pressure returns to normal

**Tunica media:** the smooth muscle that can *contract* (vasoconstriction) or *relax* (vasodilation)

**Baroreceptor Reflex:** Negative feedback loops regulate BP near set-point when **MAP** (mean arterial pressure) increases
* Sympathetic system influences a  variety of cardiovascular tissues; acts on arteries, ventricles, SA node
* Result = lower BP.

### Evolution of the Autonomic NS
Divisions of ANS often not as well defined in ‘lower’ vertebrates; greater reliance on **circulating catecholamines (NE, E)**
* E.g dogfish: no sympathetic innervation of heart, relies completely on circulating catecholamines

**Exception of ANS:** Adrenal medulla
* **Chromaffin Cells:** modified, *neurosecretory* postganglionic neurons
* **Adrenal Medulla:** highly  modified sympathetic ganglion
* Chromaffin cells secrete epinephrine and norepinephrine into *circulation* → widespread effects
* Most vertebrates have adrenal glands that secrete into the circulation, but mammals are the only ones who have a dedicated medulla.

## Nervous System Summary
1) Information transmission in the nervous system relies on both electrical (AP) and chemical (synapses) events.
2) The functional unit of the nervous system is a reflex arc; it is based on neurons, the structural unit of the nervous system.
   * Nervous system complexity is achieved by structural and functional complexity (more neurons, more complicated interactions)
3) The vertebrate NS consists of the CNS (brain and spinal cord) and PNS (afferent nerves, efferent motor nerves of the somatic and autonomic divisions).
   * The CNS collects and integrates sensory input and determines appropriate motor output.
   * Somatic motor neurons are specialized for fast transmission and are always excitatory.
   * The ANS is a key system for the neural control of bodily function: it consists of two divisions differing in anatomy, pharmacology, and physiology.
