# Lecture 4: Autonomic Nervous System

## Distinguish between the sympathetic and parasympathetic  divisions of the ANS on structural, functional and pharmacological grounds.

## Contrast and compare the nicotonic and muscarinic cholinergic synapses

## Describe pharmacological tools (and their effects) that can be used at a muscarinic cholinergic synapse

## Contrast and compare a muscarinic cholinergic synapse with an adrenergic synapse

## Distinguish between alpha and ÃŸ adrenoreceptors

## Describe pharmacological tools (and their effects) that can be used  at adrenergic synapses
