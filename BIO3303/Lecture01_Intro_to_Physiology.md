# Lecture 1: Introduction to Physiology

**Physiology:** The study of the function of organisms as integrated systems of molecules, cells, tissues, and organs in normal and diseased states; *how organisms work.*
* Incorporates from many fields like chemistry, physics, math, ecology, etc.
* **Comparative Physiology:** The study of functional diversity among animals OR Understanding how and why different species work differently

## History of Physiology
**Aristotle:** Father of Natural History (~384 BC)

**Hippocrates:** Father of Medicine (~460 BC); greatly influenced thinking of those that followed.

**Galen:** Founder of Physiology (~199 AD); First to design experiments to understand how the body works

**Vesalius (1514-1564):** Wrote the first modern anatomy textbook, demonstrated Galen's errors, and triggered modern study of *anatomy and physiology.*

**Scholander (1905-1980):** first and most influential comparative physiologist

**Schmidt-Nielsen (1915-2007):** saw how animals live in extreme environments

**George Bartholomew (1923-2006):** founder of the field of *ecological* physiology

2) Comparative physiology

## Unifying Themes in Physiology

### 1. Physiology is integrative.
Animal physiologists study phenomena at multiple levels of organization from molecules to ecosystems. Animal physiologists address both basic and applied questions.

### 2. Physiological processes obey the laws of chemistry and physics.
* **Chemical laws** govern interactions between biological molecules (E.g. weak bonds are sensitive to temperature)
* **Mechanical concepts** apply to physiological systems (flow, pressure, resistance, strain, fluid dynamics)
* Animals use **electricity** to drive processes (Cells establish charge differences across biological membranes by moving ions and molecules to create ionic and electrical gradients)

### 3. Physiological processes are shaped by evolution.
**Phenotype:** physical characteristic of an organism (e.g. skin colour)

**Genotype:** the specific genetic makeup of an organism.
* Evolution determines genotype, which determines how an organism develops its phenotypes and how it reproduces.

**Phenotypic plasticity:** production of different phenotypes by a single genotype as a result of environmental changes
* Changes can be *reversible* or *irreversible*
* **Acclimatization:** *reversible* process of physiological change in response to *naturally changing* environmental conditions.
* **Acclimation:** *reversible* process of physiological change in response to a *controlled or manipulated* environmental variable (under laboratory conditions)
* **Polyphenism (developmental plasticity):** *irreversible* development under different conditions results in different adult phenotypes. E.g. Water fleas (Daphnia) develop differently in the presence of predators.

**Reaction norm:** the range of phenotypes that can be produced by a given genotype when it is exposed to different environments

**Environmentally-Mediated Variation** of fish on land vs fish in water: Land raised fish walked more ‘effectively’ and had changes in anatomy.

**Physiological systems show tremendous variability:** Variability arises through adaptive and random evolutionary processes

**Adaptation:** change in the *genetic structure* of a population as a result of natural selection
* **Do not** use adaptation in the context of phenotypic plasticity, which is beneficial change that occurs over the course of a lifetime (e.g. exercise).

**Requirements for Adaptive Evolutionary Change:**
1) Must be variation among individuals in the trait 
2) Trait must be heritable
3) Trait must increase fitness
4) Relative fitness of different genotypes depends on environmental conditions
* E.g **Insecticide resistance:** Individuals with mutations conferring resistance to neurotoxic insecticides survive and reproduce; Individuals with the mutation are less resistant to temperature changes; If pesticide is no longer used, and temperatures shift, the mutations would be selected against.
* Some variations are **not** adaptive: Genetic frequencies can change due to random events 
  * **genetic drift:** e.g. population bottleneck

Evolutionary relationships predict morphological, physiological and behavioural similarities; Closely-related species have more similarities in physiological systems than distantly-related ones.

### 4. Physiological systems are usually regulated.
* **Conformers:** allow internal conditions to change with variation in external conditions
* **Regulators:** maintain constant internal conditions regardless of the external conditions (aka **Homeostasis**)

Regulations typically occurs through **negative and Positive feedback loops**
* **Negative feedback loops:** maintain parameters within optimal physiological range (homeostasis)

* **Homeostasis:** maintenance of a constant internal state (e.g. body T⁰ in mammals = 37⁰C)
* **Enantiostasis:** maintenance of function when physiological variables are changing (E.g. Maintaining membrane fluidity at different T⁰)
  * in a new environment, the animal’s internal conditions change but physiological function is **maintained** through alternate action

## Summary: Physiology is...

1) A discipline with a long history and tradition
2) Focussed on all levels of biological organization from molecular to ecological
3) The basis of integrative biology, in that physiology is the link between genes and behaviour
4) Incredibly diverse, but based upon a number of unifying themes
