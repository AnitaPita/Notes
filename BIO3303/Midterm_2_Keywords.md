### Lecture 10
* **Sensory Physiology:** The study of how sensory stimuli are transduced by sensory receptors and processed by the nervous system
* **Sensory System:** sense organ + afferent sensory neuron + area of brain to which these neurons project
  •	E.g.: Visual system has eyes, optic nerve, brain areas concerned w/ processing visual info
* **Sense organ:** receptor cells + accessory non-neural tissues, E.g.: Eye
* **Sensory receptors:** cell that is specialized to detect incoming sensory stimuli (E.g.: rods and cones)
* **Receptor proteins:** proteins on membranes of sensory receptors (cell) specialized to detect incoming sensory signals (e.g. opsin)
* **Classification of sensory receptors:** either by location or by stimulus modality
* **Exteroceptors:** detect stimuli occurring on the outside of the body (e.g. Pressure, temperature, etc.)
* **Interoceptors:** detect stimuli occurring inside the body (e.g. Blood pressure, blood oxygen)
* **Stimulus:** form of external energy to which a receptor responds (chemo-, mechano-, photo-, thermo-, magneto-, electroreceptor)
* **Polymodal receptor:** receptors sensitive to multiple modalities (e.g. Ampullae of Lorenzini (shark nose): electricity, touch and temperature; Nociceptors (humans and other animals): detect strong stimuli of temperature, pressure, chemicals, among others; detection of pain)
* **Steps in sensory reception:** reception, transduction to electrical signal, transmission to integrating centre, perception of the stimulus at the centre
* **Types of sensory receptors:** sensory neuron or epithelial sensory receptor cell
* **Sensory neuron (sensory receptor neuron):** Is an afferent neuron; stimulus leads to a type of graded potential called “generator potential” and AP generated at trigger zone if threshold reached; goes directly into neuron
* **Epithelial sensory receptor cell:** Graded potential called: “receptor potential”; releases neurotransmitter causing graded potentials and APs in an associated primary afferent neuron; goes through second cell that has receptor protein
* **Stimulus encoding elements:** modality (type of stimulus), intensity, location, duration
A. Encoding Stimulus Modality
* **Stimulus modality:** Most receptors are maximally sensitive to 1 type of stimulus (adequate stimulus); in general, same types of sensory receptors synapse with the same afferent neuron
* **Labeled-Line Theory:** Johannes Muller, Modality based on receptor type and afferent neuron; requires high degree of receptor specificity
* **AP Temporal Patterns:** in polymodal receptors, change the pattern of APs: “oh diff frequency so that means heat’s coming in as opposed to touch, e.g.”
* **Cross-fiber coding:** Several neurons are in close proximity with diff sensitivities and compare the relative sensitivities
B. Encoding Stimulus Intensity
* **Stimulus Intensity:** APs are all-or-none electrical events of the same magnitude, graded (receptor/generator) potentials vary in magnitude and affect rate of APs; intensity coded through changes in frequency of APs
  -	Stim can activate 1+ receptor cells; large stim = large number of receptor cells (e.g. strong mechanical force/touch or high amplitude sound -> large deformation; how many neurons fire)
* **Dynamic range:** range of intensities over which stimuli are encoded by receptor cells
  *	Below threshold intensity, the receptor fails to initiate APs (stimulus too weak = no response)
  * Affected by: receptor protein saturation, all ion channels open/closed, membrane potential change maxes out (i.e. reaches equilibrium potential of ion), max rate of release of neurotransmitters, Maximum frequency of APs in afferent neuron (set by refractory periods, dynamic range 1000-fold)
  * Receptor A: detect broad range of stimulus intensities, but has low power to discriminate among different intensities
  * Receptor B: detect narrow range; but provide fine discrimination within that range
* **Range fractionation:** group of receptors, each sensitive to a different range, work together to provide finer discrimination across a wider range of intensities; A kicks in and is sensitive until x intensity, which kicks in B, which is sensitive until y intensity… etc.; extends the dynamic range and increases sensory discrimination
* **Logarithmic Encoding:** in some receptors, discrimination of stimulus = fine @ low intensity, coarse @ high intensity (magnitude of response plateaus); e.g. Candle light in dark room vs bright room
* **Subjective sensation:** what we think we feel; as things get brighter, it may gets brighter linearly, but we perceive it logarithmically
* **Fechner's law:** states that subjective sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity
* **Weber-Fechner relationship:** logarithmic relationship between actual and perceived stimulus intensity (e.g. brightness and weight)
C. Encoding Stimulus Location
* **Receptive Field:** region of sensory surface that, when stimulated, generates a response in the primary afferent neuron
* **Population coding:** information about stimulus encoded in pattern of firing of multiple neurons
  -	“Neuron 7 is firing hardest while others have less so 7 is where the point of stim is mainly”
* **Lateral inhibition:** increases contrast between signals from neurons at the center of the stimulus and neurons on the edge, allowing further discrimination
* **Contrast Enhancement:** Lateral inhibition crucial for photoreceptor receptive field organization and visual processing; enhances contrast for improved detection of edges and gradients (grey square illusion/Herman grid)
D. Encoding Stimulus Duration
* **Tonic receptors:** fire APs as long as the stimulus continues; convey information about how long the stimulus lasts
* **Receptor adaptation:** AP frequency declines even when the stimulus intensity is maintained at a constant level
* **Phasic receptors:** fire APs only when the stimulus begins (adapt quickly); convey information about changes in stimulus but not duration 
* **Pacinian Corpuscle:** Mechanoreceptor in skin, sensitive only to changes in pressure, Phasic response due to peripheral filtering from lamellae
* **Lamellae (“onion skin”):** separated with fluid act as a filter; fluid redistributes, relieving initial distortion of sensory terminal; If lamellae removed, pacinian corpuscule act more as a tonic receptor.
* **Chemoreception:** Taste, smell (olfaction), ECF composition
* **Mechanoreception:** Stretch receptors, Hearing (Audition), Balance (Proprioception), BP
* **Photoreception:** Sight and visual processing
* **Modality Similarities:** stimulus parameters encoded by AP rate and pattern
* **Modality Differences:** Highly specific transduction mechanisms

### Lecture 11

* **Chemoreceptor:** cell specialized for transduction of environmental chemicals
  * Internal: detect changes in O2, CO2, and pH
  * External: detect airborne and dissolved chemicals (olfaction and gustation)
* **Mammalian Chemoreceptive Organs:**
  * Gustation: taste buds, oral cavity (especially tongue, also larynx, soft palate), esophagus
  * Olfaction: Odorants (olfactory epithelium), Pheromones (vomeronasal organ which is vestigial in humans)
* **Flehmen Response:** Curling of upper lip to facilitate the transfer of pheromones into vomeronasal organ
* **Aquatic Vertebrate Gustation:**
  * Gustation: taste buds usually in oral cavity and around mouth (fun fact: all over catfish)
  * Olfaction:
    * **Agnathans (lampreys):** one olfactory organ with a single nostril
    * **Elasmobranchs (sharks and rays):** the paired olfactory pits or sacs are usually situated on the ventral side of the snout
    * **Teleosts (most bony fishes):** the paired olfactory organs are usually located on the *dorsal* side of the head
* **Taste vs Smell:**
  * *Gustation*: Chemicals are in contact with the animal; typically dissolved chemicals at relatively high concentrations
  * *Olfaction*: Chemicals are concentrated at a distance; airborne chemicals or dissolved chemicals at low concentrations
  * **Physiological Distinction**: 
    * Different sense organs and receptor cells
    * Different signal transduction mechanisms
    * Separate integrating centres
* **Chemical Transduction:** chemoreceptors are specialized sensory cells of neural/epithelial origin; chemical stimulus binds to membrane-bound receptor protein that regulates permeability of cell membrane through various transduction mechanisms
  * Signal gets transmitted to **frontal cortex** for processing (that's where the gustatory and olfactory cortices are found)

* **Taste/Gustation:** Determines food location and quality; may be the most primitive sensory modality
  * **Taste receptors:** epithelial sensory cells
  * **Taste bud:** Cluster of taste receptors (50-100); the apical surface is folded into microvilli which contain receptor proteins
    * Reach to the surface of the tongue via pore
    * have supporting cells
    * rapid turnover (10-14 days)
  * **Tastants:** Dissolved chemicals from food that enter through the pores on taste buds
  * **Gustation pathway:** 
    1. Tastant binds to receptor proteins on microvilli to initiate a receptor potential
    2. NT is released to primary afferent neurons
    3. Cranial nerves 7/9/10 (VII/IX/X) project it to the CNS (thalamus)
    4. Thalamus relays the signal to the *gustatory cortex* of the brain
  * **Number of taste buds in vertebrates:**
    * Catfish = 180 000! (90% are extra-oral)
    * Calf = 25 000
    * Pig = 15 000
    * Human = 9 000
    * Pigeon = 37
    * Snake = 0
  * **5 Categories of Taste:** 
    * Sweet (saccharides and sugars): hedonic (indicates nutritionally important food)
    * Salty (Na+): hedonic
    * Sour (HCl): Indicates presence of toxins/spoiled food
    * Bitter (caffeine, quinine): Indicates presence of toxins/spoiled food
    * Umami (L-glutamate, amino acids, MSG): hedonic
  * **Taste encoding:** Recent studies support the **Labelled-Line Theory** ("one cell, one taste" coding scheme)
  * **Salty Transduction Mechanism**
    * Receptor protein = ENaC, where ligand = Low NaCl and sodium salts
      1. Na+ from salty food enters through a Na+ channel
      2. The resulting depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
      3. Influx of Ca2+ causes neurotransmitter release
    * ENaC is also permeable to to H+ (sour taste); in animals with low Na+ in saliva, the receptor detects sour (e.g.: Hamster)
    * **Salt deficiency** triggers *aldosterone* secretion -> enhances Na+ retention by kidney and increases ENaC expression in taste receptor cells to induce craving for salty foods
  * **Sour Transduction Mechanism**
    * Receptor protein *in mammals* = PKD2L1, where ligand = acids i.e. Citric, tartataric acid, HCl
    * Mechanism differs by organism
      1. **Salamander:** taste receptor cells express K+ channels which are blocked by H+ -> decreased K+ permeability = depolarization -> VG-Ca2+ channels open -> high [Ca2+] causes NT release
      2. **Frogs:** H+-Gated Ca2+ channels and H+ transporters
      3. **Mammals:** PKD2L1 channel, Acid-sensing  ion channels (ASICs); involve pH-sensitive Na+ channels
  * **Sweet Transduction Mechanism**
    * Receptor protein = T1R2+T1R3, where ligand = Sugars, artificial sweeteners, D-Amino acids, Glycine, and sweet proteins
    * Broad-spectrum receptors detect many kinds of sweet substances
      1. Chemical binds to receptor -> cause conformational change -> activate **gustducin** (a G-protein)
      2. Adenylate cyclase activated, which activates ATP -> cAMP, which activates protein kinase, which phosphorylates K+ channels (close) and causes depolarization
      3. Depolarization opens VG Ca2+ channels and causes NT release to afferent neuron
    * Some substances may also activate IP3-mediated signal transduction cascade which closes K+ channels also
  * **Bitter Transduction Mechanism**
    * Receptor protein = T2Rs, where ligand = Cycloheximide, Denatonium, Salicin, PTC, Saccharin, Quinine/strychine/atropine
    * Sensation: unpleasant but bearable when weak; repulsive when strong; prevents ingestion of harmful compounds
    * ~30 genes code for bitter taste receptors
      1. Binding causes conformational change which activates **transducin** (G-Protein)
      2. Phospholipase C (PLC) is activated, causes PIP2 -> IP3
      3. IP3 releases Ca2+ from intrAcellular stores; increase in [Ca2+] causes NT release
  * **Umami Transduction Mechanism**
    * Receptor protein = T1R1+T1R3, where ligand = L=glutamate, Nucleotide enhancers e.g. AMP, GMP, IMP
    * "Umami taste" comes from foods w/ L-glutamate, other AAs, and MSG
      1. Glutamate binds to glutamate receptor, conformational  change, activating a G protein
      2. G protein activates phosphodiesterase (PDE) that degrades cAMP into AMP
      3. Decreases in cAMP thought to trigger NT release
    * Precise pathway not fully described yet; it appears several pathways are involved.
  * **Taste Map in Gustatory Cortex:** *in vivo* imaging look at neural response to tastant in gustatory cortex of mice; specific areas show high neural activity in response to bitter but not to sweet/sour tastants
    * Taste qualities are topographically organized in gustatory cortex (**Gustotopic Map**); however, **area for sour taste not found**

* **Smell/Olfaction:** Detects huge variety of odorants; two systems in vertebrate (**Main olfactory** and **vomeronasal**)
  * Receptors **regenerate**, but slower than in gustatory; **Detection Threshold** of chemicals lower than in taste receptors
  * **Olfactory receptor cell**: sensory neurons (bipolar) embedded in the olfactory epithelium and project into olfactory bulb of brain
    * Olfactory cell membrane project to the surface of epithelium and mucus layer and are covered in cilia
    * Small structural differences in odorants can lead to significant diffs in perceived odor (e.g. rose vs sweat)
    * **Odorant-Binding Protein:** Allow lipophilic odorants to  dissolve in aqueous mucus layer
  * **Odour Transduction Mechanism**
    1. Binding of odorant to a receptor causes conformational change
    2. Activated G-Protein (Golf) moves through membrane to activate Adenylate cyclase
    3. AC converts ATP cAMP 
    4. cAMP opens cAMP-gated ion channels 
    5. Ca2+ and Na+ enter the cell, causing a **generator potential**
    5b. Ca2+ also opens Ca2+-activated Cl- channels, making Cl- exit the cell and increasing depolarization
    6. Generator potential opens VG Na+ channels which triggers APs.
    * Other signal transduction pathways also involved, e.g. PLC-mediated signal transduction cascade
  * **Olfactory Receptor Diversity:** Multigene family (Olfactory-Receptor genes)
    * GPCRs, first cloned in 1991 by Richard Axel & Linda Buck (2004 Nobel Prize)
    * Usually comprises ~1-5% of total genes (e.g. 1000 in rats/mice, 500-750 in humans, 100 in catfish, 500 in *C. elegans*
    * Humans detect **~10 000** odours
  * **Combinatorial Encoding:** pattern of activation of olfactory receptor cells codes for particular odorants
    * Most odours are composed multiple odorant molecules; each activates several odorant receptors
    * A receptor cell can only detect 1 type of receptor, but the receptor proteins can recognize >1 odorant (with varying intensity)
    * **Glomerulus:** collection of synapses; ~2000 in the olfactory bulb
    * Info is transmitted from sensory neuron to glomeruli in olfactory bulb (individual glomeruli receive inputs from receptor cells expressing same receptor
    * Secondary sensory neurons (**mitral cells**) project from glomeruli to olfactory cortex
    * Info is already integrated before reaching the cortex
  * While mammals have one type of receptor protein per receptor cell...
    * **Drosophila:** Usually one novel type of receptor protein and one  ubiquitous receptor protein per receptor cell
    * **C. elegans:** many  types receptor protein per receptor cell, BUT Odorant code can't be a simple combinatorial  system like in  mammals
  * **Vomeronasal Organ:** Accessory olfactory structure in terrestrial vertebrates highly sensitive to pheromones
    * **Location:** Opens to oral or nasal cavity but isolated from main airstream; air entry via pumping (flehming)
    * DIFFERENT from olfactory epithelium: Different receptors and gene families (but still GPCR), uses PLC -> IP3 signal transduction pathway
  * **Sensilla:** sense organ consisting of chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors; involved in gustation, olfaction, detection of  pheromones, hearing, and touch; found in **arthropods**
    * Odorants pass through a pore and activate olfactory receptor proteins expressed on sensory neuron dendrites
    * Mechanism: cAMP mediated second messenger cascade
* **Evolutionary Story:** Most birds don't have T1R2 sweet receptor, so how do hummingbirds find nectar?
  * Answer: **Umami T1R1+T1R3 was repurposed** to function as a carbohydrate detector
