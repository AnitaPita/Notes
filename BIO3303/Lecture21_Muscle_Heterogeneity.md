# Lecture 21: Muscle Heterogeneity

## Sonic Muscles 

**Sonic Muscles:** Sound production organs work in combination with muscles specialized for producing high frequency contractions
* **Rattlesnake shaker organ:** Tail shaker muscles contract at *90Hz*
* **Toadfish:** “boat whistles” mating call; Sonic muscles vibrate swim bladder at *200Hz*
* **Cicada:** produce buzzing sounds by distorting exoskeleton by contracting tymbal muscles *(500Hz)*

### Toadfish Muscles
Muscle Types:
* Sonic muscle: 200 Hz
* red muscle (steady swimming): 2 Hz
* white muscle (burst swimming): 5 Hz

Superfast twitch to prevent tetanus (swim bladder would be compressed and would not vibrate).

Fast Ca2+ transients, fast relaxation. Due to:
1) Rapid Ca2+ release and reuptake (more SR Ca2+ pumps)
2) Troponin needs faster off-rate for Ca2+ (lower affinity type troponin)
3) Cross-bridged must detach more rapidly (molecular modification of myosin)

Specializations limit the ability of sonic muscles to generate force (Force ↓):
* ↑ SR = ↓ myofilament volume (*space constraints*)
* Less cross-bridges are formed per unit time because of *high detachment rate*

## Muscle Diversity
**Trans-differentiation:** muscle diverted from typical development to create tissue with novel, non-contractile functions
* In strongly and weakly electric fish:
  * **Electrocytes:** electric organs are modified muscle cells
  * Loss of contractile apparatus
  * Stimulation	produces electric discharge
* In Billfish (swordfish and sailfish):
  * **Heater organ** associated with optical system warms visual system and maintains visual acuity in deep, *cold* water to capture prey

Aside: Muscles produce heat as by-product of metabolism in mitochondria during mitochoxidative phosphorylation (ATP production)
* Heat is produced in reactions leading to ATP hydrolysis (E.g. myosin ATPase and Ca2+ pump ATPase)

### Heater Organ
* No organized myofilaments (Few loose actin and myosin)
* Lots of mitochondria, SR and T-tubules
* **How they generate heat:** by cycling Ca2+ through sarcoplasmic reticulum...
  1) Ca2+ leaves SR through RyR
  2) Ca2+ pumped back into SR through SERCA (ATPase) fueled by mitochondrial ATP
  3) **Result** = Warms eye and optic nerve
* Heat is generated through:
  1) ATP production (substrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation)
  2) ATP hydrolysis by Ca2+ ATPase pump (SERCA)

## Invertebrate Muscles
Some smooth, some striated, many in between; Many invertebrates have **obliquely striated muscles** (vs cross-striated)
* Lots of variation in arrangement of thick and thin filaments (ratios ranging from 1:3 to 1:10  or more)
* Look at *vertebrate striated* vs *insect asynchronous*
* Core of thick filaments are  made of **paramyosin** (myosin attached around it)

* **Vertebrate twitch muscle:** Contraction all-or-none in response to neural inputs
* Invertebrate muscles have *graded responses* to neural input and have **multiple motor end plates**
* **Single stimulus:** few Nt released, small EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential), small Ca2+transient, weak contraction
* **Multiple stimuli:** graded response (summed EPSP); *more* Nt release, more depolarization,  greater Ca2+release, strong contraction
* **Complex Innervation:** Innervated by 1 or multiple neurons; neurons may be excitatory to varying degrees (weakly or strongly) **or** inhibitory

## Insect Flight Muscles
**Synchronous insect flight muscles (Orthoptera, Odonata):** 
  * Single AP, single contraction-relaxation cycle
  * Ca2+ kinetics limit contraction frequency
  
**Asynchronous insect flight muscle (Hymenoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera):** 
* Nervous stimulation not synchronized with contraction, 
* Single AP, many contraction-relaxation cycles
* e.g. Blowfly flight muscle contraction frequency = 125Hz, but Speed of AP arrival = 3 Hz
* Permit contraction frequencies of up to 1000Hz
* **How they work:**
  * Transition btw contraction and relaxation *does not require a ↓ in Ca2+*; [Ca2+] remains high
  * *Muscle sensitivity* to Ca2+ ↓ after contraction; Ca2+released from TnC
  * Muscles relax, then get stretched by elastic elements
  * **stretch-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity:** Contraction is activated by stretch; TnC affinity for Ca2+ is regained

* **Direct flight muscles:** attach via ligaments to wing base (*synchronous*)
* **Indirect flight muscles:** not attached directly to wings (***a**synchronous*)
  * Muscular distortions of thorax are what move the wings
  * **Vertical muscles:** pull on thorax -> roof wings rise -> stretch longitudinal muscles
  * **Longitudinal muscles:** pull on thorax -> Lower wings -> stretch vertical muscles
  
## Contraction Regulation
Contractile properties of muscles are determined by **molecular properties of cellular machinery** (Thin and thick filaments, regulatory proteins, ion channels, pumps, etc.) as well as **diversity of isoforms**.
* Genetic repertoire allows muscle remodelling during development and in response to physiological changes (exercise, temperature).

## Vertebrate Skeletal Muscle Fibre Types
**Twitch fibers:** phasic fibers

**Tonic fibers:** non-twitch fibers
* **found in:** postural muscles of amphibians, reptiles and birds; muscle spindles of animals
* No twitch contractions
* Contractions = *graded* according to rate of APs
* Resistant to fatigue

**Fast-Twitch:** White muscle, Glycolytic, Type IIb Myosin Isoform
* Phosphorylation: Glycolytic
* High levels of: glycogen stores
* Fiber diameter: Large
* Mitochondria count: High
* Force production: High
* Fatigue? Yes

**Slow-Twitch:** Red muscle, Oxidative, Type I Myosin Isoform
* Phosphorylation: Oxidative
* High levels of: myoglobin (Oxygen)
* Fiber diameter: Small  
* Mitochondria count: Low
* Force production: Low
* Fatigue? Resistant

### Fish Muscle Fiber Types
Swimming muscles in fish composed of **homogeneous** fiber types (typically vertebrates have heterogeneous fiber types)
* **White muscle:** most of the body mass of fish
  * **Function:** High intensity, burst swimming
* **Red muscle:** confined to a narrow ribbon extending along side, and also at the base of the fins
  * **Function:** Slow, cruising swimming

* Physiological Significance?
  * two distinct layers plus an intermediate (Type IIa); variable layer (in some)
  * **Electromyography** indicates that red muscle is used for cruising, while white muscle is used for sprinting.

## Muscle Heterogeneity
**tetrapod locomotory muscles:** Mosaics of muscle fibre types
* Orange: Type I fibers
* Green: Type IIa fibers
* Blue: Type IIb fibers
* Black: Type IIx/d fibers

**Immunohistochemistry:** Fluorescent antibodies bind to specific MHC isoforms

Diversity of isoforms are expressed over time (development and remodelling). This also happens between **homologous muscles** in different species.
* **Calf muscle:** fibers of a given type grouped together and recruited as a group
  * Type I fibers internal, Type IIb fibers external
