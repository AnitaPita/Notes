# Lecture 14: Vision

## Vertebrate Retina Functional Organization

1. Photoreceptors release **glutamate** at synapse with bipolar cells
  * **Light induces *hyperpolarization*; glutamate release decreases**
2. **Effect** on bipolar cell depends on glutamate receptor expressed
  * Glutamate can excite or inhibit bipolar cell
3. Horizontal cells are excited by glutamate and release GABA to inhibit neighbouring photoreceptors
5. Bipolar cells make excitatory connections with ganglion cells

**OFF-Bipolar cell:** one that's **excited** by glutamate
* Photoreceptor hyperpolarized by light, decreases glutamate release
* Result: **bipolar cell not excited** and does not send a message
* Light hits center photoreceptors -> hyperpolarization of *associated* bipolar cells
* Light hits surround photoreceptors -> depolarization of bipolar cells

**ON-Bipolar cell:** one that's **inhibited** by glutamate
* Photoreceptor hyperpolarized, decreases glutamate release
* Result: **Bipolar cell gets excited** and sends a message
* Light hits center photoreceptors -> depolarization of *associated* bipolar cells
* Light hits surround photoreceptors -> hyperpolarization of bipolar cells

**On-Center receptive fields** and **Lateral Inhibition**:
* Since glutamate is not released, horizontal cells are NOT excited (no GABA release)
* No GABA release means no lateral inhibition in neighbouring cells
* Neighbouring cells have increased glutamate release and get more inhibited
* **Result:** Contrast detection (e.g. grey-square illusion)

**Lateral Inhibition mediates Contrast Enhancement:**
* Without lateral inhibition we would have a graded response to light-dark boundary
* **With lateral inhibition:** much larger difference in responses of neighbouring photoreceptors (integration done by inhibitory interneurons)

## Retina
The retina starts visual info processing
* **Horizontal cells and Amacrine cells:** related to lateral inhibition
* **Embryonic development:** Retina originally part of the brain
* Photoreceptors and interneurons emit **graded potentials**, except ganglion cells (they send APs to the brain)

**Colour Detection:** humans can distinguish thousands of colours
* Only **3 types of cones** maximally sensitive to different wavelengths:
  * blue cone (Short)=430 nm
  * green cone (Medium)=530 nm
  * Red cone (Long)=560nm
* Depends on the **comparison of activity** in different photoreceptors
* Light of given wavelength induces responses in multiple cones; colours are interpreted as **ratio of responses of various cones**
* Every colour causes a  certain activity on all three cones
  * Relative output of all types of cones are processed to estimate colour

**Color Processing:** 
* Lateral inhibition by horizontal cells is also important for colour processing
* **Colour-contrast neurons**: excited by one colour and inhibited by the opposing colour
  * **Center-surround organization** (red and green cones)
* Ganglion cells add and subtract signals from many cones in receptive field
  * e.g. determines the amount of red-green or blue-yellow (opposing colours) (**yellow** = sum of red and green cone inputs)
  
### Diversity in Colour Detection
* Most **mammals** are **dichromats or monochromats** (Many nocturnal species and marine mammals often lack color vision (monochromats)) * **Trichromatic** colour vision has evolved twice in **primates**
* **Birds, reptiles, shallow-water fish:** trichromatic, tetrachromatic or pentachromatic
* **Species Differences in  Colour Detection:**
  * **Photoreceptor proteins:** expressed by some organisms; respond to wavelengths outside human visible spectrum
  * **UV colour discrimination**: involved in many behaviours including **mate selection, foraging and prey detection**
  * **Ultraviolet sensitivity**: in birds, mice, bees (trichromat but detect UV light, helps identify pollen sources), also some fish
  * **UV Detection: Northern Swordtails**
    * Males display UV ornamentation
    * Enhances attractiveness to females but not detected by major predators

### Visual field Representations

* **Visual field:** region of space detected by the retinas of both eyes
* **Binocular zone:** region where visual fields of left and right eyes overlap
* **Optic nerves:** Axons of retinal ganglion cells
* **Optic chiasm:** Point at which axons cross to other side of the brain
* **Optic tracts:** Continuation of optic nerve from optic chiasm
* **Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN):** Thalamic nucleus that receives and processes visual information
* **Visual Cortex:** Integrates visual information
* The brain preserves spatial information from the visual field

Each eye is divided into **nasal** and **temporal** region
* **Left Eye:** Nasal = left visual field, Temporal = right visual field
* **Right Eye:** Nasal = right visual field, Temporal = left visual field
* Some fibers cross at the optic chiasm (*amount* depends on size of binocular zone and varies between species)
  * **Fish and amphibians** with eyes on each side of head? **no binocular zone** -> 100% crossing
  * **Humans:** large binocular zone of which 40% fibers uncrossed, 60% crossed

**Central Visual Processing**
* LGN sends projections to the **primary visual cortex**
* Representation of visual field and retinal images in cortical regions
* Areas of binocular zone represented in both halves of the brain and **Disparities are compared** (depth perception, 3D vision)
* Neurons in cortex show selective responses to complex stimulus features (**Orientation selective neurons, Direction selective neurons**)

**Orientation Selectivity:** Orientation selective neurons in the visual cortex are tuned to orientation of stimulus
* Respond selectively to stimulus bars oriented at particular angles

**Direction Selectivity:** Some neurons in cortex respond preferentially to movement of stimulus in one direction
* Differential responses to movement in different directions (Changes in AP frequency, timing and pattern)

**Visual Cortex:** Right visual field  represented in left  hemisphere and left visual field represented in right hemisphere (**inverted representation**)
* **Striate cortex:** layered organization of the visual cortex
* **Retinotopic mapping:** 

**Cortical Processing:** very complex
* Because they do not  have lenses, do organisms who have  pigmented plate or  pigmented cup eyes see everything upside down?

**The dress:** Mid-day light is closer to ultraviolet while morning/evening light is more infrared 
* Integration cortex calculates how it should perceive things based on time of day
