# Lecture 12: Mechanoreception

**Mechanoreceptor Ion Channels:** There are two types that are stretch-activated with two attachment points: Extracellular matrix proteins and cytoskeleton.

1. **ENaCs** (Epithelial sodium channels)
2. **TRP** (transient receptor potential) **channels**

* Mechanical forces cause displacement of extracellular anchoring proteins resulting in conformational change
* There are NO intracellular cascades since mechanoreceptors are ion channels directly connected to the cytoskeleton
* Sensory Transduction is similar in inverts and vertebrates 
* **Location** and/or **peripheral filtering mechanisms** determine whether it is activated by sound, gravity, acceleration, or water currents

**TYPES OF MECHANORECEPTORS**

1. Touch and Pressure
  * Baroreceptors (vertebrates)
  * Tactile Receptors (vertebrates AND invertebrates)
  * Proprioceptors (vertebrates AND invertebrates)
  
2. Equilibrium and Hearing (both in invertebrates and vertebrates)
  * Statocysts
  * Hair Cell Neuromasts
  * Electroreceptors

## Touch and Pressure

### Baroreceptors (Vertebrate only)
Baroreceptors detect pressure changes in walls of blood vessels, parts of the heart, digestive, digestive, reprodutive, and urinary tracts
* E.g.: **Carotid Sinus baroreceptors** monitor blood pressure to the brain

### Tactile Receptors
Detect touch, pressure, and vibration on the body.
#### (Vertebrates)
**Tonic Receptor Cells:** Detect light touch and pressure on the skin surface
* **Free Nerve Ending:** Sensory neurons with dendrites interspersed among epidermal cells (there are receptor proteins on the dendrites)
* **Merkel's Disks:** Enlarged epidermal cell (Merkel Cells) associated with free nerve endings
  * Have a small receptive field (*fine* discrimination)

**Phasic Receptor Cells:** Detect movement or pressure on skin surface
* **Root hair plexus:** Nerve endings wrapped around base of hair follicles and respond when hair is displaced
  * Detect changes in movement across body surface
* **Pacinian Corpuscles:** Sensory dendrite surrounded by lamellae
  * Located in skin (deep), muscles, joints, and internal organs
  * Detect changes in **pressure**
  * Large receptive field, poor discrimination; especially sensitive to vibration

**Ruffini Corpuscle:** *Slowly-adapting tonic receptor* cells: dendrite endings with elongated capsule
* Location: connective tissue of skin and with connective tissue of joints and limbs
* Sensitive to: stretching of skin and mvt of joints
* help detect position of body in space (proprioceptor)

#### Invertebrates
They have cuticles, so how do they sense mechanical changes?

**Trichoid Sensilla:** Hair-like projection of cuticle; bends in response to touch or vibration
* An accessory structure transfers mvt of sensilla to dendrite of bipolar sensory neuron and opens stretch-sensitive TRP ion channels
* Very sensitive: detect small changes in air movements

**Campaniform Sensilla:** Similar to trichoid sensilla except they lack hair shaft; have **dome-shaped projection** of cuticle
* Found in clusters, especially near **joints of limbs**
* Function: Detect cuticle deformation as insect moves and allows for coordinated movement

### Proprioceptors
Tonic receptors (constant message to CNS); encode info about body position; 

1. Muscle spindle
  * Where: Surface of skeletal muscles
  * What: consist of *intrafusal fibers* (modified muscle fibers enclosed in connective tissue capsule)
  * Function: Monitor muscle length (AP firing rate is related to how far thespindle stretches)
2. Golgi Tendon Organs
  * Where: at junction between skeletal muscle and tendon
  * Function: Sense tendon tension
3. Joint Capsule Receptors
  * Where: capsules that enclose the joints
  * What: Many types similar to Pacinian corpuscles, Golgi tendon organs, free nerve endings, etc.
  * Function: Detect pressure, tension and mvt in joint

## Equilibrium and Hearing
Detects position of body relative to the force of gravity.
* Vertebrates: **ear** involved in equilibrium and hearing
* Invertebrates: Equilibrium organs are **separate** from hearing organs

### Statocysts (Invertebrates)
Statocysts are hollow, fluid-filled cavities lined with ciliated mechanosensory neurons
* **Statoliths:** dense particles of calcium carbonate within statocysts
  * Change in body orientation disturbs statoliths and their motion stimulates receptor proteins on cilia
* **In Cephalopods:** complex, paired statocyst system
  * **Cristae:** detect angular acceleration (turning)
  * **Macula:** detect linear acceleration (forward motion)
  * Macula and 3 cristae contain statoliths and mechanosensitive neurons
  * This system is similar to the **vertebrate vestibular system**.

### Hair Cells (Vertebrates)
Hair cells are **epithelial sensory receptor cells**
* They synapse with an afferent neuron
* Transduce mechanical stimulus into electrical signal
* Distributed in different sensory organs serving diverse functions
* 1 long **kinocilium** (absent in mammals). Many **stereocilia** in a tight bundle that contain few actin filaments at the base (**flexible**)
* **Tip Links:** small fibers that link stereocilia together. Connected to ion channels via *elastic proteins* (springs)
  * Pull open channel or push it closed 

**Vertebrate Hair cells**
* Mechanoreceptor proteins are located on the tips of the stereocilia 
* **TRP channels** are found here; 15% are open at rest (membrane potential = -60mv)
* **[K+]** *around* the hair cell is high, and enters when the channel is open
