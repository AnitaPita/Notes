# Lecture 12: Mechanoreception

**Mechanoreceptor Ion Channels:** There are two types that are stretch-activated with two attachment points: Extracellular matrix proteins and cytoskeleton.

1. **ENaCs** (Epithelial sodium channels)
2. **TRP** (transient receptor potential) **channels**

* Mechanical forces cause displacement of extracellular anchoring proteins resulting in conformational change
* There are NO intracellular cascades since mechanoreceptors are ion channels directly connected to the cytoskeleton
* Sensory Transduction is similar in inverts and vertebrates 
* **Location** and/or **peripheral filtering mechanisms** determine whether it is activated by sound, gravity, acceleration, or water currents
