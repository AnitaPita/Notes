# Lecture 2: Nervous Systems

## Contrast and compare the nervous and endocrine systems.

* **Endocrine system:** releases chemical messengers (hormones) into circulatory system and are carried to target tissues
* **Endocrine Cell:** all glands that secrete hormones; release hormones into circulation.

* **Nervous System:** Electrical signal travels in neuron, Release chemicals (neurotransmitters) into space between neuron and target cell.
* **Neurons:** release neurotransmitters into synapse to communicate directly with target (postsynaptic) cell

## Explain how neuroendocrine cells span the divide between the nervous and endocrine systems.

The NS and endocrine system interact extensively.
1) Stimulus -> endocrine gland -> bloodstream -> target organ -> response (*purely endocrine*)
2) Stimulus -> sense organ -> sensory neuron -> integrating centre -> neuron -> target organ -> response (*purely NS*)
3) Stimulus -> sense organ -> sensory neuron -> integrating centre -> neuron -> endocrine gland -> hormone through bloodstream -> target organ -> response
4) Stimulus -> sense organ -> sensory neuron -> integrating centre -> neuron -> endocrine gland 1 -> circulatory system -> endocrine gland 2 -> circulatory system -> target organ -> response

## List the structural and functional units of the nervous system.
* **Soma:** cell body
* **Dendrites:** receive incoming signal that results in change in membrane potential
* **Axon hillock:** initiate action potentials
* **Axon:** can be myelinated or unmyelinated
* A signal travels along axon to axon terminals and triggers neurotransmitter release
* **Neuronal diversity:** they all have an area for reception, integration, conduction, and transmission.
  * **Cnidarian Neuron:** "physiologically conventional; are insensitive to tetrodotoxin.

## Ion concentration gradients and permeability establish membrane potentials.

**Resting membrane potential = ~-70mV**; Concentration gradients maintained by Na+/K+ pumps to compensate for leaks

### Ion Channel Types
* **Ligand-gated:** open when ligands (neurotransmitter) bind
* **Voltage-gated:** open when there is a specific change in membrane potential (open at specific stages of an action potential)

## Distinguish among membrane, action and synaptic potentials, explaining the physiological basis of each.

**Membrane Potential Changes:** Movement of ions causes changes in membrane potential
* **Na+ enters:** membrane potential becomes more positive (+)
* **K+  leaves:** membrane potential becomes more negative (-)

**Signal transmission:** A signal travels down the axon to the terminals to communicate with other neurons, muscles or other target cells; they meet at the *axodendritic synapse*.
* A **presynaptic neuron** transmits signal to the **postsynaptic neuron** (receiving neuron)

**Graded Potentials:** Activated by ligand- gated Na+ channel, cause changes in membrane potential
* Are considered **synaptic potentials** 
* spatially restricted response 
* Conduction with decrement (membrane potential decreases exponentially with distance); graded potentials are spatially (potentials at different points in the membrane) and temporally (potentials at slightly different times) summated to cause or prevent AP generation.
1) Nt binds to ligand-gated Na+ channel
2) Na+ enters cell through the open channel
3) Current spreads through the cell
4) The strength of the signal decreases with distance
* **Electrical signals:** Graded changes in membrane potential occur in dendrites and cell body
  * Are spatially and temporally summated; If combined depolarization exceeds threshold, an *action potential* is generated
  * Spatial summation can also prevent generation of APs if inhibitory potential > excitatory potential.

### Action Potential
Net change in membrane potential at the axon hillock reaches/exceeds threshold (*suprathreshold* graded potential)
* an action potential is triggered and travels down the axon: **non-graded**, **all-or-none** signal transmission.

**Stages of an AP:**
1) Graded potential from membrane depolarized past threshold potential (- 55mV)
2) Rapid depolarization until 30mV; caused by opening of VG Na+ channels (influx)
3) Membrane potential repolarizes; caused by opening of VG K+ channels (efflux) and closing of VG Na+ channels
4) Hyperpolarization due to membrane potential undershooting resting potential
5) Resting potential restored
* **Absolute Refractory Period:** Period during and immediately after an AP in which an excitable cell cannot generate another Ap
* **Relative Refractory Period:** Period after the Absolute Refractory period in the cell can generate an AP only if exposed to a suprathreshold potential.
* Refractory periods prevent backwards transmission (the inactivation gate on the the Na+ channels is active until after the refractory period, by which point the AP has travelled towards the axon terminal).

VG-channels shape an action potential: **Activation gate** opens at threshold, and **inactivation gate** closes at +30mV
* K+ channels open more slowly than Na+ channels.

**Conduction of APs:** Na+ enters, induces a local depolarization, opens Na+ channels nearby, 

### Case Study: Takifugu rubripes
Japanese puffer fish contain tetrodotoxin (TTX), which blocks VG ion channels.
* Therefore they prevent action potentials; 1 mg is deadly
* The fish is safe because of a single mutation in their Na+ VG ion channels.

## Signal Transmission
**Myelin Sheath:** Schwann cells wrapped around axons; insulates to increase speed/efficiency of transmission

**Nodes of Ranvier:** unmyelinated axon, has lots of VG Na+ channels
* **Saltatory conduction:** APs jump from node to node along axon

Signal transmission is done via *cell-to-cell* communication and can be either *electrical* or *chemical*.
**Electrical Synapse:** gap junctions composed of connexin proteins connect presynaptic and postsynaptic cell membranes; found in quick, short responses (**pores** allow fast transmission)

**Chemical Synapses:**
* **Ionotropic Receptor:** ligand-gated channels at a chemical synapse; **rapid** changes in postsynaptic membrane potential 
* **Metabotropic Receptor:** signaling cascade opens ion channels; Activates intracellular *transduction pathway*. **Slower** changes in postsynaptic membrane potential. Can also modify proteins and gene expression (e.g. learning, memory)

## Describe a reflex arc.

**Simple Neural Network:** Sensory information detected by receptor → Signal transmitted from sensory neuron → efferent neuron → effector organ (response)

Evolution of Neural Networks:
* **Ancestral Neural Network:** receptor cell directly innervates an effector cell (little processing, no CNS)
* **Monosynaptic Neural Network:** sensory neuron synapses with efferent neuron (e.g. *knee-jerk* reflex)
* **Polysynaptic Neural Network:** at least one interneuron between sensory and efferent neuron (increases processing capacity)

**Reflex Arc:** sensory neurons relay stimulus to giant interneuron at terminal ganglion; signals motor neuron
* E.g. Cockroach jump: Sensory neurons (*afferent*) in filiform hairs detect wind and sound waves (*stimuli*)
  * Relays signal to giant interneuron in the terminal ganglion, Signals leg motor neuron (*efferent*) to cause contraction of leg muscles

* **Convergence:** many afferent neurons synapse with one efferent neuron
* **Divergence:** one afferent neuron synapses with many efferent neurons
  * Divergence allows a single signal to control many independent processes, and it is a way to amplify the signal
  
### Aplysia Gill-Withdrawal Reflex
**Habituation:** Simple kind of learning. A decline in the tendency to respond to a stimulus due to repeated exposure.
* partial inactivation of voltage- gated Ca2+ channel in axon terminal of sensory neuron → less transmitters are released

**Sensitization:** an increase in the response to a gentle stimulus after exposure to a strong stimulus.
* Electric shock to tail sensitizes response to siphon stimulation
* **Facilitating interneurons:** in the gill example, while shocking the siphon multiple times habituates it, shocking the tail causes the facilitating interneurons to send the same type of response to the gill to withdraw.

## Plasticity of Nervous System
Facilitating neurons release serotonin (5-HT) on sensory neuron axon terminals.
* Serotonin activates metabotropic receptor. Causes a **short-term** response by initiating a cAMP pathway and leads to *more Nt being released.*
* **Long-term sensitization:** PKA enters nucleus, activates gene transcription to ↑ responsiveness and formation of new synapses.
