# Lecture 23: Animal Energetics

* **Metabolism:** the sum of all chemical reactions in a biological entity
* **Metabolic rate:** the rate of conversion of energy to heat and external work
* **Respirometry:** the ratio of O2 consumption and CO2 production used to determine heat production and fuel used

Metabolic fuel being used is reflected in **respiratory quotient (RQ)**
* **Birds:** 
  * At rest: oxidize lipid fuels (RQ=0.7)
  * In flight: use glycolytic pathways (RQ rises to ~1)
* **Pacific Salmon:**
  * feed and grow in ocean prior to energetically depleting migration; fuel used changes throughout migration
    * Must rely on inner stores: Mobilization of triglycerides from muscle and adipose tissue
  * Lipid stores used first, BUT then Glycogen is stored or replenished throughout migration
    * Glycogen is reserved for high intensity spawning behaviours
  * **Hormones** act at locomotor muscles and storage sites to control the flow of metabolic substrates to ATP-producing machinery

## Measurements of Metabolic Rates
* Metabolic rate can be quantified by **heat production and external work** (assuming growth/biosynthesis is minimal)
* **Basal metabolic rate (BMR):** measured in *endoderms*; fasting, resting, no temperature stress (**thermoneutral zone**)
* **Standard metabolic rate (SMR):** measured in *ectoderms*; fasting, resting, temperature specified

**Calorimetry:** Direct measurement of heat production.
* **Inventors:** French scientists Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) and Pierre-Simon  Laplace (1749-1827).
* Is technically challenging to do well: is animal-constrained, and low metabolic rates cause accuracy issues
* Direct measurement of metabolic rate, therefore most accurate

**Respirometry:** 
* glucose + 6 O2-> 6CO2 + 6H2O + 2820 kJ/mol
* O2 consumption and/or CO2 production can be used to estimate heat production
* Respiratory exchange ratio  R = MCO2/MO2
* **Closed vs open respirometry:**
* **Human VO2max testing:** Increase physical activity level until a maximum VO2 is reached and individual cannot exercise further

**Bomb Calorimetry:** Estimation of metabolic rate using a ‘balance sheet’ approach
* Calculation = Energy intake – energy loss
  * I.e. Calorimetry of organic matter that enters and leaves animal
* Energy of food and wastes calculated by heat of combustion
* **Benefit:** Works well over longer periods of time (at least 24hrs)
* **Limitation:** Not all food energy is available to the animal; they may store energy as fat and/or use energy reserves to support metabolism

**Doubly-Labelled Water:** Rate of production of CO2 estimated from rate of loss of isotopes of O and H 
* Is an estimation of metabolic rate from production of radiolabelled water and CO2
* Ratio of traceable H to traceable O in body estimates the amount of traceable O that left via CO2
  * Labelled O becomes CO2 and H2O, see how much of each is produced
  * Labelled H becomes H2O, see how much of that comes out
  * **Principle:** figure out how much labelled H is found, and then subtract that from the total amount of labelled O to figure out how much CO2 was produced
* **Benefit:** Allows metabolic rate estimations of animals in the field behaving normally
* **Limitation:** Must know the RQ of the fuel being burned to know energy produced, and it makes many assumptions

## Factors affecting Metabolic Rate
1) Fasting
2) Resting
3) Temperature

### Fasting and Food Processing
**Specific dynamic action (SDA):** cost of food processing. 
* Eating takes energy.
* O2 consumption increases within an hour of eating.
  * Peaks 3-6hrs later and remains elevated several hours longer.
  * Suggests SDA is more the assimilation of food rather than digestion and absorption of food.
* SDA is proportional to *size of meal* and *quality of meal*.
* SDA for protein **>** SDA for fats and carbohydrates.
* Varies by animal group 
  * e.g. metabolic rate post-feeding is 44x fast for **pythons** but only 1.5x faster for humans
    * Pythons need to rebuild a dormant digestive system, so the wet mass of their small intestine decreases over a long period of time.
    * Eat their food over a span of 7 days
  * In contrast, a sprinting human raises her metabolic rate x18 but a galloping racehorse does so **x45**

### Resting and Activity
Metabolic cost of locomotion varies with many things.
* **Animal group** matters (reptiles are less efficient than mammals).
* **Skeleton type** matters (hydroskeleton has a higher cost than rigid skeletons).
* But most importantly: **
   1) Animal size
   2) type of locomotion
   3) velocity**

**Cost of Transport (COT)**
* COTtotal = metabolic rate / locomotor velocity = O2 consumed / distance

**Scaling of Metabolic Rate with Body Size:**
* More cells = more metabolism, but not as much as you'd expect... Metabolic rate (kcal h-1) ∝ mass^0.75
  * Result = Big animals are more efficient to run

1) **Animal Size:** Effects of size on resting MR – big animals are more efficient to operate.
   * **Drag:** **Drag ∝ surface area** and **Muscle power ∝ volume**
     * Smaller animals have  higher surface area : volume ratio
     * This means more drag = less muscle power
   * **Speed of Shortening:** Small animals have higher rates of contraction; 
      * More steps are required per unit distance.

2) **Types of Locomotion** (See graphs on slide 24).
   * **Runners:** must overcome gravity; COM bobs up and down
     * The faster you go the more it costs you
   * **Flyers:** create lift during flight
     * Forward velocity increases lift; hovering is expensive to create lift w/o forward velocity. Increasing velocity increases drag costs at higher speeds
   * **Swimmers:** must maintain a neutral buoyancy; *drag* becomes an issue at high velocities.

3) **Velocity**
   * Flight: costs high at low velocity to generate lift
   * Swimming: rag increases as velocity increases quadratically
   * Running: COT decreases as speed increases (walk vs trot vs gallop)

### Temperature

**Metabolic Cost of Endothermy:** 4-10 fold difference.
* Metabolic rate becomes a function of environmental temperature (endotherms vs ectoderms)

### Finally...
**Many other factors** affect metabolic rate, such as:
* Age
* Reproductive Status
* O2 Levels
* ..and much more!
