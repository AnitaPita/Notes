# Lecture 24: Biomechanics

## Muscles are organized
* **Muscle fibers** are organized into **fasciles**, wrapped by **perimysium**, covered by **epimysium**, attached to **tendons**...
* **Sarcomeres** are organized into **myofibrils**, which are organized into **myofibers**, which are organized into **skeletal muscle**
* Sarcomeres are made up of **thin and thick filaments** and have **z-disks**, **m-lines**, **a-lines**...

## Muscle Function Varies
* Motor neuron properties
* Contraction frequency
* Motor end plate organization
* T-tubules and AP propagation
* SR structure
* Ca2+ buffering
* Thin and thick filament protein isoforms and orientation

## Whole animal muscle integration

1) Material properties of connective tissue and skeleton
   * **Tendon:** Made of collagen 85% and attaches muscle to bone. Is **elastic** *to an extent*. 
     * **Extensibility** – LOW 10%
     * **Strain energy storage:** only spider silk  beats it; relative to mass, it's better than steel
     * **Resilience:** 93% (only thing better is resilin, which is found in insects)
   * **Ligament:** Made of collagen 70% and attaches bone to bone.
   
2) Specialization for **force generation** or **shortening velocity**
* Consider the same number and size of sarcomeres: **series** = fast but weak, **parallel** = slow but strong
* They have same number of actin and myosin connections.
* In *long* sarcomeres, they are all attached to the weight.
* In a *series* of short sarcomeres they are each attached to each other.
* A muscle is **only as strong as the shortest link.**

3) Whole muscle geometry to fit in more sarcomeres
* Each sarcomere only gives a tiny length change and tiny force
* **Strap muscles:** few in parallel, might be long, but not a lot of force produced since not enough in parallel
  * If you can jam more in parallel, get more force out of that muscle
  * Strap = straight length change
* **Spindle/pennate muscle:** angle of sarcomeres is different; gives angle of motion; not as much shortening in terms of distance
   * Results in more lines of sarcomeres in parallel; by angling, we can create a lot more force
* **Width** determines the amount of force a muscle can produce.

## Antagonistic Muscle Groups 
Definition: Groups that do opposing movements to allow you to move around joints in both directions.
* **Locomotor Module:** All  muscles responsible for a type of movement
  * **Flexion vs Contraction:** either biceps contracts or tricep contracts.

## Determining Function from Anatomy: Flappers vs Hoverers
* Flight muscles are attached to the **keel** of a bird
   * The **Supracoracoideus** raises the wing and the **pectoralis** lowers it
* **In flappers:** Wings back up is almost passive because of physics, but lots of muscles required to stroke down
   * Result: Pectoralis is way bigger than the supracoracoideus
* **In hoverers:** Supracoracoideus and pectoralis are approximately the same size because both up and down must be power strokes
   * It’s expensive to hover, but *hummingbirds* have a niche to fill
   * Metabolically it’s more “costly” to have two large muscles but it’s not a big deal
* **Concluision:** Can tell a lot about motion by looking at similarities in the anatomy

## Bones and Muscles as Levers
* **Class 1 Lever:** magnify/amplify force (e.g. crowbar)
  * The farther out you are on a crowbar, the more **force** you can apply on lifting a rock with the crowbar
* **Class 2 Lever:** (wheelbarrow); you can carry more than if you just lifted the rock up
* **Class 3 Lever:** (biology); no mechanical advantage (fulcrum not in the right place) BUT you get an augmentation of speed, and range of motion.
  * If you’re further from the fulcrum than the weight is, then you have a mechanical advantage
  * **Cheetah vs Lion limbs:** if you move the muscle closer to the joint in the **cheetah**, the movement is faster but has less force
    * Moving the muscle further out in the **lion** makes you have more force but be slower
  * Increased speed and range of motion at the cost of force
   * **Door Analogy:** Think of pulling a door from far away from where the hinge (requires less force)
     * if the handle is close to the hinge, the movement is fast but it requires more force
     * **The farther you are from a fulcrum, the easier it is to pick something up.**

## Elastic Energy
* Skeletons and tendons can store elastic energy
* Muscles contract and some of that energy is  stored in elastic components (tendons, bent  bones)
* When muscle relaxes, stored energy helps muscles stretch *for free*; no need for an antagonist
* **Kangaroo Awesomeness:** COT increases during  walking, but remains constant during hopping
  * Kangaroos have incredible **achilles tendons**; the tendons get loaded and then they bounce the kangaroo forward
  * Compare that to a horse with different gaits @ diff speeds: theres is an *optimal speed* where COT is minimized for each gait
* **Invertebrate Awesomeness:** while they have Regular flexor muscles, they also have a secondary mechanism
* Elastic sclerite deformation during flexion (little sclerite pad is very elastic)
* Sclerite recoil after muscle relaxation to extend leg (when flexor muscle relaxes, the sclerite bounces the leg back out)
