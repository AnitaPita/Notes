# Lecture 13: Photoreception

**Photoreceptor:** transduces energy from photons into changes in membrane potential
**Photopigment:** protein with chromophore, changes conformation when absorbs light
* Activates signal transduction cascade leading to graded changes in membrane potential and Nt release
**Photoreceptive organs:** Structures specialized for light detection, encode direction, intensity of light, and contrasts; large diversity

### Visible Spectrum

Photoreceptors respond to a small portion of electromagnetic spectrum (300-1000nm)
* Visible spectrum  (humans) = 350-750nm (variable in other species)
* Photoreceptors evolved in aquatic ancestors: light **attenuates** (loses intensity) in  water, only some  wavelengths penetrate into water column

### Photoreceptor classes
The classes have Distinct signal transduction mechanisms
**Rhabdomeric Photoreceptors:** Apical surface contains photopigments in microvillar projections
**Ciliary Photoreceptors:** Single cilium projection from cell body; Ciliary membrane often highly folded into lamellae or disks containing photopigments

**Photoreceptor Diversity:** invertebrates only have rhabdomeric photoreceptors and vertebrates have two types ciliary receptors

### Ciliary Photoreceptors: Rods and Cones
* **Outer segment** (facing the environment) connected to **inner segment** (connecting to neurons) by cilium
* Outer segment composed of a series of membranous discs filled with photopigments
* Inner segment connects to synaptic terminals (synapse with other cells)
* Rod and cones have structural and functional differences in:
  * Number of photpigments expressed
  * Roles in dim vs bright light
  * Position on the retina

**Rods vs Cones**:

1. Rods: **slower responses** than cones
2. Rods: integrate stimulus over a **longer period** than cones
3. Rods: have **more photopigments** than cones
4. Rods: sensitive to very **dim light**, while Cones: don't work as well in dim light
5. Rods: **saturate** at relatively low light intensity while Cones: function best in bright light

**Nocturnal Animals:** higher ratio of rods to cones; eyes better adjusted to vision in low light levels

**Ciliary Photoreceptor Diversity:** Many vertebrates have more than 1  type of photoreceptor cell.
* Each type has a different photopigment **maximally sensitive** to a particular wavelength
* **In frogs:** rods detect colour whereas in turtles it is cones
* Shape of photoreceptor doesn’t determine wavelength it responds to: **photopigment expressed** on the photoreceptor does

### Photopigments
* Photopigments activate signal transduction cascades when light energy is absorbed
* **Photopigment = Receptor protein** that contains a vitamin A derivative pigment called a **chromophore** (e.g. **retinal**)
* **Opsin:** G-protein coupled receptor covalently linked to chromophore
* Photopigments are member of opsin gene family
* Chromophore-opsin complex varies in different photoreceptors

**Photoreceptor Diversity:** Different types of photopigments: different opsins linked to different chromophores (Vit-A derivatives)
* E.g. rhodopsin, iodopsin, melanopsin
* Use different signal transduction cascades that lead to depolarizing or hyperpolarizing receptor potentials
* Opsin amino acid sequence determines the sensitivity to particular parts of light spectrum

**Chromophore Activation:**
* Inactive photopigment state: chromophore in cis conformation
* When the chromophore absorbs incoming light: changes to an all-trans conformation (eg. 11-cis retinal to all-trans retinal)
* All-trans retinal reconverted into 11-cis retinal by isomerase (ATP-requiring process that takes several minutes)

**Photobleaching:** all-*trans* chromophore gets released from opsin protein after it's been created
* In vertebrates: reconversion occurs in accessory cell (**pigment epithelium**)
* In invertebrates: occurs in the photoreceptor
* Opsin-cis chromophore complex regenerated at the end

**Photo Transduction in Invertebrates:** Phospholipase C Pathway
  1. 11-cis 3-hydroxy retinal absorbs light and isomerizes into all-trans 3-hydroxy retinal
  2. All-trans 3-hydroxy retinal dissociates from opsin
  3. Activated opsin activates a G protein -> activate PLC -> converting PIP2 to DAG and IP3 -> DAG activates TRP cation channel
  4. Ca2+ and Na+ enter the cell and depolarize it
  * In invertebrates, response to light makes membrane potential *increase gradually* (**depolarize**); sharp decrease when light off

**Photo Transduction in Vertebrates:** cGMP Pathway
  1. 11-cis 3-hydroxy retinal absorbs light and isomerizes into all-trans retinal
  2. All-trans retinal dissociates from opsin
  3. Activated opsin activates a G protein **transducin**-> activate PDE -> converting cGMP to GMP -> closes Na+ channels
  4. Na+ leaves the cell and hyperpolarize it
  * In vertebrates, response to light makes membrane potential *decrease gradually* (**hyperpolarize**); sharp increase when light off

**Light responses:** Graded responses encode stimulus intensity; Brighter light leads to larger hyperpolarization
* Amplification occurs at different points in signal transduction cascade; increases sensitivity (rod sensitive to 1 photon,  amplification = close several channels)

### Evolution of the Eye

* Photoreceptor vs eye
* Eye provides directionality
* Only 6 of ~30 metazoan phyla produce  images

**Pax-6 gene:** Transcription factor that regulates eye  development in vertebrates
* Identified in *Drosophila* but a homologue was found in squid

**Image formation without eyes** 
* **Sea urchins:** significant orientation towards a sufficiently large target
* Diffuse dermal photoreceptors + spines to provide directional sensitivity but with limited spatial resolution

### Types of eyes

**Pigmented plate (flat-sheet eye):** Photoreceptor layer (retina) + pigment shielding

**Pigmented eye cup:** Directionality but poor image, found in many worms

**Compound eye:** "mosaic eye" that sees ~2-3 degrees of visual field each
* Ommatidia: functional units of arthropod compound eye
* Ants have less ommatidia than dragonflies because they chemosense their prey, not visualize them
* 8-12 retinular cells –  rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells
* **Rhabdom** = aggregated microvilli of rhabdomeres of retinal cells
* **Insect Apposition eye:** Independent ommatidia, founding in **diurnal** insects
* **Insect Superposition eye:** Separation of lens from rhabdom; increases light-gathering power but decreases image resolution
  * In nocturnal insects
  * **Light-induced pigment migration:** Night adapted pigment is withdrawn from **clear zone** (area between rhabdom and crystallized cone); Day adapted pigment migrates to the clear zone

**Camera eye:** Pinhole aperture with lens to focus light; found in vertebrates and some cephalopods
* Improved image-forming ability
* **Cornea:** induces refraction and gives the eye protection
* **Iris:** peripheral filter
  * *circular muscle* controls constriction via *parasympathetic* pathway
  * *Radial muscle* controls dilation via *sympathetic* pathway
* **Lens:** fine-tunes the refraction by accommodation either by **moving the lens** (aquatic animals) or by **changing lens shape** (terrestrial animals) via ciliary muscles
  * **Presbyopia:** decreased accommodation with age
 
 **Accommodation:** process by which the eye changes its focal length
 * Changes in lens position relative to retina:
    * **Polychaetes:** annelid worms; Change volume of fluid in eye to change the distance between lens and retina
    * Most **invertebrates** alter focal length by moving lens forward or backward
 * Changes in lens shape:
    * **Lizards, birds, and mammals** all alter focal length by changing shape of lens
 * **Focal Point:** where light waves converge after passing through the lens
 * When the focal length becomes too long or short, lens becomes more curved and bends light more to maintain image on retina (which should be the focal point)
 
**Vertebrate Retina:** has multiple layers
* Photoreceptors = Rods and cones @ back of retina, and are embedded in **pigment epithelium**
  * Function: Form synapses with layers of **bipolar cells** which synapse with a layer of **ganglion cells**
  * Axons of ganglion cells run along surface of retina and join to form optic nerve
  * **Optic nerve:** exits retina at **optic disk** (no photoreceptors here)

### Organization of the Retina

* Photoreceptors are in the deepest retinal layer so light must pass through bipolar cells and ganglion cells before reaching photoreceptors
  * **Fovea:** exception where light doesn't have to pass through the other cells; this is where sharpest images are formed
  * called a **visual streak** in non-primate mammals
* Rod and cone distribution not uniform  across retina
  * Rods distributed in periphery while cones more abundant in center of eye (fovea)
* Amount of convergence also varies
  * Fovea (where highest concentration of cones is): one photoreceptor, one bipolar and ganglion cells
  * Periphery: more convergence, i.e. many photoreceptors to 1 bipolar cell (mostly rods here)

**Cephalopod eye:** Photoreceptors arranged differently in retina than vertebrates
* No other layers besides photoreceptor layer
* Photoreceptors located on surface of retina
* **Support cells** *between* photoreceptors
* Axons of photoreceptors form the animal's optic nerve
* **Overall:** Fewer components and less  visual processing

**Vertebrate Retina:** Photoreceptors release glutamate at synapse with bipolar cells
* Light= hyperpolarization -> glutamate release decreases
* Effect on bipolar cell depends on glutamate receptor expressed (**excitatory** or **inhibitory**)
* **Bipolar cells** make excitatory connections with ganglion cells
* **Horizontal cells**: inhibit neighbouring bipolar cells
