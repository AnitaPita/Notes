# Lecture 11: Chemoreception

**Chemoreceptor:** cell specialized for transduction of environmental chemicals
* Internal: detect changes in O2, CO2, and pH
* External: detect airborne and dissolved chemicals (olfaction and gustation)

**Mammalian Chemoreceptive Organs:**
* Gustation: taste buds, oral cavity (especially tongue, also larynx, soft palate), esophagus
* Olfaction: Odorants (olfactory epithelium), Pheromones (vomeronasal organ which is vestigial in humans)

**Flehmen Response:** Curling of upper lip to facilitate the transfer of pheromones into vomeronasal organ

**Aquatic Vertebrate Gustation:**
* Gustation: taste buds usually in oral cavity and around mouth (fun fact: all over catfish)
* Olfaction:
  * **Agnathans (lampreys):** one olfactory organ with a single nostril
  * **Elasmobranchs (sharks and rays):** the paired olfactory pits or sacs are usually situated on the ventral side of the snout
  * **Teleosts (most bony fishes):** the paired olfactory organs are usually located on the *dorsal* side of the head

**Taste vs Smell:**
  * *Gustation*: Chemicals are in contact with the animal; typically dissolved chemicals at relatively high concentrations
  * *Olfaction*: Chemicals are concentrated at a distance; airborne chemicals or dissolved chemicals at low concentrations
  * **Physiological Distinction**: 
    * Different sense organs and receptor cells
    * Different signal transduction mechanisms
    * Separate integrating centres

**Chemical Transduction:** chemoreceptors are specialized sensory cells of neural/epithelial origin; chemical stimulus binds to membrane-bound receptor protein that regulates permeability of cell membrane through various transduction mechanisms
  * Signal gets transmitted to **frontal cortex** for processing (that's where the gustatory and olfactory cortices are found)

## Gustation
**Taste/Gustation:** Determines food location and quality; may be the most primitive sensory modality
* **Taste receptors:** epithelial sensory cells
* **Taste bud:** Cluster of taste receptors (50-100); the apical surface is folded into microvilli which contain receptor proteins
  * Reach to the surface of the tongue via pore
  * have supporting cells
  * rapid turnover (10-14 days)
* **Tastants:** Dissolved chemicals from food that enter through the pores on taste buds
* **Gustation pathway:** 
  1. Tastant binds to receptor proteins on microvilli to initiate a receptor potential
  2. NT is released to primary afferent neurons
  3. Cranial nerves 7/9/10 (VII/IX/X) project it to the CNS (thalamus)
  4. Thalamus relays the signal to the *gustatory cortex* of the brain
* **Number of taste buds in vertebrates:**
  * Catfish = 180 000! (90% are extra-oral)
  * Calf = 25 000
  * Pig = 15 000
  * Human = 9 000
  * Pigeon = 37
  * Snake = 0
* **5 Categories of Taste:** 
  * Sweet (saccharides and sugars): hedonic (indicates nutritionally important food)
  * Salty (Na+): hedonic
  * Sour (HCl): Indicates presence of toxins/spoiled food
  * Bitter (caffeine, quinine): Indicates presence of toxins/spoiled food
  * Umami (L-glutamate, amino acids, MSG): hedonic
* **Taste encoding:** Recent studies support the **Labelled-Line Theory** ("one cell, one taste" coding scheme)
* **Salty Transduction Mechanism**
  * Receptor protein = ENaC, where ligand = Low NaCl and sodium salts
    1. Na+ from salty food enters through a Na+ channel
    2. The resulting depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
    3. Influx of Ca2+ causes neurotransmitter release
  * ENaC is also permeable to to H+ (sour taste); in animals with low Na+ in saliva, the receptor detects sour (e.g.: Hamster)
  * **Salt deficiency** triggers *aldosterone* secretion -> enhances Na+ retention by kidney and increases ENaC expression in taste receptor cells to induce craving for salty foods
* **Sour Transduction Mechanism**
  * Receptor protein *in mammals* = PKD2L1, where ligand = acids i.e. Citric, tartataric acid, HCl
  * Mechanism differs by organism
    1. **Salamander:** taste receptor cells express K+ channels which are blocked by H+ -> decreased K+ permeability = depolarization -> VG-Ca2+ channels open -> high [Ca2+] causes NT release
    2. **Frogs:** H+-Gated Ca2+ channels and H+ transporters
    3. **Mammals:** PKD2L1 channel, Acid-sensing  ion channels (ASICs); involve pH-sensitive Na+ channels
* **Sweet Transduction Mechanism**
  * Receptor protein = T1R2+T1R3, where ligand = Sugars, artificial sweeteners, D-Amino acids, Glycine, and sweet proteins
  * Broad-spectrum receptors detect many kinds of sweet substances
    1. Chemical binds to receptor -> cause conformational change -> activate **gustducin** (a G-protein)
    2. Adenylate cyclase activated, which activates ATP -> cAMP, which activates protein kinase, which phosphorylates K+ channels (close) and causes depolarization
    3. Depolarization opens VG Ca2+ channels and causes NT release to afferent neuron
  * Some substances may also activate IP3-mediated signal transduction cascade which closes K+ channels also
* **Bitter Transduction Mechanism**
  * Receptor protein = T2Rs, where ligand = Cycloheximide, Denatonium, Salicin, PTC, Saccharin, Quinine/strychine/atropine
  * Sensation: unpleasant but bearable when weak; repulsive when strong; prevents ingestion of harmful compounds
  * ~30 genes code for bitter taste receptors
    1. Binding causes conformational change which activates **transducin** (G-Protein)
    2. Phospholipase C (PLC) is activated, causes PIP2 -> IP3
    3. IP3 releases Ca2+ from intrAcellular stores; increase in [Ca2+] causes NT release
* **Umami Transduction Mechanism**
  * Receptor protein = T1R1+T1R3, where ligand = L=glutamate, Nucleotide enhancers e.g. AMP, GMP, IMP
  * "Umami taste" comes from foods w/ L-glutamate, other AAs, and MSG
    1. Glutamate binds to glutamate receptor, conformational  change, activating a G protein
    2. G protein activates phosphodiesterase (PDE) that degrades cAMP into AMP
    3. Decreases in cAMP thought to trigger NT release
  * Precise pathway not fully described yet; it appears several pathways are involved.
* **Taste Map in Gustatory Cortex:** *in vivo* imaging look at neural response to tastant in gustatory cortex of mice; specific areas show high neural activity in response to bitter but not to sweet/sour tastants
  * Taste qualities are topographically organized in gustatory cortex (**Gustotopic Map**); however, **area for sour taste not found**

## Olfaction
**Smell/Olfaction:** Detects huge variety of odorants; two systems in vertebrate (**Main olfactory** and **vomeronasal**)
* Receptors **regenerate**, but slower than in gustatory; **Detection Threshold** of chemicals lower than in taste receptors
* **Olfactory receptor cell**: sensory neurons (bipolar) embedded in the olfactory epithelium and project into olfactory bulb of brain
  * Olfactory cell membrane project to the surface of epithelium and mucus layer and are covered in cilia
  * Small structural differences in odorants can lead to significant diffs in perceived odor (e.g. rose vs sweat)
  * **Odorant-Binding Protein:** Allow lipophilic odorants to  dissolve in aqueous mucus layer
* **Odour Transduction Mechanism**
  1. Binding of odorant to a receptor causes conformational change
  2. Activated G-Protein (Golf) moves through membrane to activate Adenylate cyclase
  3. AC converts ATP cAMP 
  4. cAMP opens cAMP-gated ion channels 
  5. Ca2+ and Na+ enter the cell, causing a **generator potential**
  5b. Ca2+ also opens Ca2+-activated Cl- channels, making Cl- exit the cell and increasing depolarization
  6. Generator potential opens VG Na+ channels which triggers APs.
  * Other signal transduction pathways also involved, e.g. PLC-mediated signal transduction cascade
* **Olfactory Receptor Diversity:** Multigene family (Olfactory-Receptor genes)
  * GPCRs, first cloned in 1991 by Richard Axel & Linda Buck (2004 Nobel Prize)
  * Usually comprises ~1-5% of total genes (e.g. 1000 in rats/mice, 500-750 in humans, 100 in catfish, 500 in *C. elegans*
  * Humans detect **~10 000** odours
* **Combinatorial Encoding:** pattern of activation of olfactory receptor cells codes for particular odorants
  * Most odours are composed multiple odorant molecules; each activates several odorant receptors
  * A receptor cell can only detect 1 type of receptor, but the receptor proteins can recognize >1 odorant (with varying intensity)
  * **Glomerulus:** collection of synapses; ~2000 in the olfactory bulb
  * Info is transmitted from sensory neuron to glomeruli in olfactory bulb (individual glomeruli receive inputs from receptor cells expressing same receptor
  * Secondary sensory neurons (**mitral cells**) project from glomeruli to olfactory cortex
  * Info is already integrated before reaching the cortex
* While mammals have one type of receptor protein per receptor cell...
  * **Drosophila:** Usually one novel type of receptor protein and one  ubiquitous receptor protein per receptor cell
  * **C. elegans:** many  types receptor protein per receptor cell, BUT Odorant code can't be a simple combinatorial  system like in  mammals
* **Vomeronasal Organ:** Accessory olfactory structure in terrestrial vertebrates highly sensitive to pheromones
  * **Location:** Opens to oral or nasal cavity but isolated from main airstream; air entry via pumping (flehming)
  * DIFFERENT from olfactory epithelium: Different receptors and gene families (but still GPCR), uses PLC -> IP3 signal transduction pathway
* **Sensilla:** sense organ consisting of chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors; involved in gustation, olfaction, detection of  pheromones, hearing, and touch; found in **arthropods**
  * Odorants pass through a pore and activate olfactory receptor proteins expressed on sensory neuron dendrites
  * Mechanism: cAMP mediated second messenger cascade

**Evolutionary Story:** Most birds don't have T1R2 sweet receptor, so how do hummingbirds find nectar?
* Answer: **Umami T1R1+T1R3 was repurposed** to function as a carbohydrate detector
