# Lecture 15: Thermoreception and Magnetoreception

## Thermoreception

**Thermoreceptors:** respond to changes in temperature within specific range
* **Central thermoreceptor (hypothalamus)**: monitors body temp
* **3 types of peripheral thermoreceptors (skin)**: monitor environmental temp
  * **Warm-sensitive** thermoreceptors: Temperature sensitive TRP channels that also bind **capsaicin** (e.g TRPv1)
  * **Cold-sensitive** thermoreceptors: Temperature sensitive channels that also bind **menthol** (TRPm8)
  * **Thermal nociceptors (pain):** start  to fire AP at 45°C in mammals and AP firing rate increases as temp increases
* **Free-nerve endings** of skin express different TRP channels (thermoTRP) with maximal sensitivity for different temperatures

### Function of Thermoreception
* Thermoregulation
* Avoid averse stimuli
* Prey detection

Infrared (IR) sensitivity found in a number of insects, and vertebrates  (pit viper, python, and boa families of snakes, as well as vampire bats).
* **Pit vipers**: Detect IR radiating from warm-blooded **prey** at distances of up to **1m**
  * **Superimposition** of thermal and visual images in brain

**Pit Organ:** Thin membrane suspended in cavity between the eye and nostril (serve as IR antenna)
* Allows for rapid heat dissipation (dense capillary network), maximizes detection of small temperature differences
* Innervated by afferent neurons of the trigeminal branch of somatosensory system.
* **TRP (TRPA1) channels expressed**
* Detect IR radiation as **heat**, not light 
  * heat-activated changes in membrane potential of trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons

**Thermoreception:**
* TRPA1 channels on pit membrane highly sensitive to small temperature differences (Detect 0.003ºC change in temperature)
* **Graded response** to temperature
* Changes in AP rate are transmitted to CNS
* Two spatially separated pits: 3D IR spatial perception
  * **Optic tectum:** where Infrared and visual info converge; IR is mapped onto the visual image

## Magnetoreception

**Magnetoreceptor:** respond to magnetic fields
* Many animals use the earth’s magnetic field to help them navigate
* **Magnetotactic bacteria:** orient themselves with magnetic field lines
  * **Magnetite:** Naturally-occurring particle
  * **Magnetosomes** (organelles) containing magnetite particles (Fe3O4)
* **Olfactory epithelium of rainbow trout:** Neurons contain particles similar to magnetite arranged in a chain (like a compass needle)
  * Transduction mechanisms still unknown
  
### Homing Pigeons
**Iron mountain in Rhode island:**  magnetic field distorted and homing pigeons get disoriented

**Walcott and Green expmt (1974):**
1. Helmholtz coil attached to  pigeon’s head
2. Pigeons released south of home on sunny days and overcast days
3. direction of magnetic field reversed
  * Sunny day pigeons go home (North)
  * Overcast days pigeons go away from home (South)*
  
* Found magnetite in upper skin of beaks (cluster of magnetite deposited between fat cells)
* Three pairs of clusters found with nerve terminals arranged in different orientations:
  * **Caudal nerve terminals:**  aligned **longitudinally**
  * **Median:** aligned **transversally**
  * **Frontal:** aligned **vertically**

**Hypothetical transduction mechanism:** Particles of magnetite associated with cell membrane of sensory receptors
* In response to external magnetic field, clusters of magnetite attract or repel one another depending on orientation of field
  * Deforms the membrane, changing the conformation of ion channels and ion permeability

Changes in magnetic field intensity encoded in AP rate in magnetoreceptor afferent neurons
* Recordings from ophtalamic nerve of **bobolinks**
* Coil system producing magnetic field aligned with magnetic vector? strength of magnetic field changes

### Sea Turtle Navigation
* Sea turtles use magnetoreception to navigate
* Arrows on map= currents of North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, around which turtles swim as they mature
* Swim in directions that keeps them in the current
* Adult turtles able to navigate by direct, straight-line routes to return to natal beach to nest (use map and compass navigation)
* Map navigation is formed with experience likely from various sensory cues

### Magnetosensory Interference
* Grazing and resting cattle and deer tend to orient bodies in geomagnetic NS direction
  * BUT **near power lines** (< 150m) no pattern of body alignment (**electromagnetic interference**)
  * **Directly under power lines**: align body relative to power lines instead
  
# SENSORY PHYSIOLOGY KEY CONCEPTS
* Coding for sensory information is similar for all sensors
* Design of sensory receptor is key to its function
  * Need stimulus detection to be specific to get true representation of  environment due to labelled-line principle
* Many non-neural cells are involved (detection, adaptation,  information processing, etc.)
* Range of signalling systems are used
  * G-Proteins are particularly common
  * Amplification is important
  * Numerous different ion channels are involved – complex
* High degree of phylogenetic conservation
  * Across different receptor types
  * Within receptor types across animal groups
* Significant adaptation of sensory capabilities
  * E.g. Hearing to echolocation
