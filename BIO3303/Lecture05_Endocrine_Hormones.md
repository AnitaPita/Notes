# Lecture 5: Endocrine System Hormones

## How the nervous system and the endocrine system are integrated

* **Endocrine system:** Release chemical messengers (hormones) into circulatory system
  * Communication via chemical signal
* **Nervous system:** Release chemicals (neurotransmitters) into synapses
  * Communication via chemical and electrical signals
* **Similarities?** Chemical messengers, receptors, physiological responses
* **Differences?** Transmission speed, infrastructure, duration of response (See lecture 2).
1) **Neurotransmitter:** Neuron feeds into another neuron
2) **Neurohormone:** Neuron feeds into bloodstream
3) **Hormone:** Endocrine cell feeds into bloodstream

**Endocrinology:** study of chemical messengers and the tissues or glands from which they are secreted

**The endocrine system:** includes all the endocrine cells and tissues which produce hormones.

**Hormone:** a chemical messenger secreted from a neuronal (**neurosecretory**) or non-neuronal cell that acts locally (paracrine) or at a distance from that cell.
* NOTE: Sometimes paracrine action included in the definition of hormone or sometimes in the definition of the endocrine system.

Multiple functions of chemical messengers complicate traditional definitions (E.g **testosterone**) 
* As a hormone: wide effects → e.g. Increase muscles, body hair,etc, but 
* Paracrine factor: local effect → stimulate spermatogenesis in adjacent cells

## Different types of signalling in the endocrine system
The endocrine system uses **indirect signalling**, which involves 3 steps:
1) Chemical messenger release
2) Transport of messenger through extracellular environment to target cell
3) Messenger binds receptor on  target cell and initiates response

### History of Endocrine Research
**Berthold, 1849:** testes and male behaviour in roosters
* First to publish work about a substance that engenders male characteristics (testosterone, isolated in 1938)
* **Remove testes from a normal cock:** loses masculine appearances and behaviours
* **Put one testis on a castrated cock:** shows masculine appearances and behaviours again (aggressive; the one testis is large)

**Bayliss and Starling, 1902:** substance stimulates pancreas to secrete digestive enzymes to small intestine (secretin)
* isolated pancreas (cut all nerves associated to pancreas)
* gut function was just fine, but something was being secreted by pancreas
* Starling, 1905 coined the term *Hormone*: from the Greek “to  excite”

**Insulin Research:**
* **Paul Langerhans, 1869:** found that within the pancreatic tissue there were clusters of cells whose function was unknown
* **Von Mering and Minkowski, 1889:** Removed dog	pancreas, resulted in diabetes-like symptoms
* **Banting and Best, UofT, 1921:** Isolated insulin from Islets of Langerhans from pancreas of dogs
  * Injection into a diabetic dog relieved diabetic symptoms
  
### Conservation of Endocrine Glands
Glands across species produce similar hormones but induce different responses in different species and target tissue 
* e.g. Thyroid hormone into tadpole = **metamorphosis**
* "Everyone uses the same tools."

## Hormone classification

### A. By Chemical Structure

**1. Peptide Hormones**
* **What:** Variable number of amino acids; Peptide = 50 aa or less, protein hormone = btw 50 and 200 aa
* **How:** Synthesized using protein machinery in secreting tissues
  1) Preprohormone synthesized in rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER)
     * Signal sequence: targets peptide for secretion
  2) Signal peptide cleaved off resulting in prohormone; packaged into secretory vesicles in golgi apparatus (GA)
  3) In secretory vesicle, prohormone is cleaved into active hormone and one or more other peptide fragments.
     * E.g Provasopressin cleavage → three peptides: AVP, NPH, GP
* **Examples:**
  * **TRH:** stimulates release of TSH and prolactin from anterior pituitary
  * **TRH-releasing hormone**
  * **TSH:** stimulates thyroid gland to produce thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine(T3) which stimulates metabolism of almost every tissue in the body
  * **GH Human growth hormone:** controls growth and metabolism
  * **ACTH:** adrenocorticotropic hormone, releases corticosteroids from anterior pituitary 

**2. Biogenic Amines**
* **What:** chemicals that possess an amine group (-NH2)  attached to a carbon; many come from amino acids
* **How:** synthesized by enzymatic  modification of precursor molecules
  * E.g **Blaschko Pathway** synthesizes catecholamines from tyrosine in the adrenal medulla (chromaffin cells) and SNS.
* **Examples:**
  * **Melatonin** (from tryptophan)
  * **Catecholamines** (from tyrosine)
  * **Thyroid hormones:** T3 and T4
  
**3. Steroid Hormones**
* **What:** cholesterol derivative
* **How:** Synthesized on demand (*not* stored) by enzymatic modification  of cholesterol in smooth ER and mitochondria
  1) **ACTH:** promotes production and release of corticosteroids 
  2) **StAR:** transport protein; regulates cholesterol transfer into mitochondria
  3) **P450scc:** catalyzes cholesterol → pregnenolone (first rxn in *steroidogenesis* in all mammalian tissues that specialize in steroid hormone production)
* **Classes:**
  1) **Glucocorticoids** (e.g cortisol produced in adrenal medulla)
  2) **Mineralocorticoids** (e.g. aldosterone produced in adrenal medulla)
  3) **Reproductive Hormones** (e.g. estrogen, progesterone, testosterone produced in gonads)
* **Ecdysteroids:** Principal steroid in invertebrates (e.g regulation of molting in arthropods)

**4. Eicosanoids**
* **What:** Short-lived, locally-acting chemical  messenger (paracrine factor)
* **How:** Synthesized by enzymatic modification of **arachidonic acid** (fatty-acid)
  * Arachidonic acid is cleaved from membrane phospholipids by **phospholipase A2**
* **Example: Prostaglandins**
  * Produced in many tissues throughout body
  * Multiple functions (smooth muscles, inflammation, cell growth, fever, pain sensitization. etc)
    * **Pain killers (ibuprofen and aspirin)**: block prostaglandin synthesis

### B. By primary mode of Action
**1. Lipid-soluble Hormones**
* **What:** Steroids and *hydrophobic* thyroid hormones; have intracellular receptors
* **Effects:** influence protein synthesis; slow, long-lasting effects

**2. Lipid-insoluble Hormones**
* **What:** Peptides, proteins, and  catecholamines; have cell-surface receptors
* **Effects:** are second messengers, effector proteins; rapid, short-lived responses

**Receptors:** binding is highly specific
* Have binding site, effector site and transduction mechanism
* Are on the cell membrane, in the cytosol, or on the nucleus
* E.g Hydrophopic chemical messengers bind to intracellular receptors in the cytosol or nucleus
  * Induce conformational change; receptor binds to DNA
  * Result = change in gene expression

**Lipid-soluble Hormone Transport:** Hydrophobic chemical messenger must be transported to target tissues via *hydrophilic carrier proteins*
1) When the local concentration of messenger is high near the signalling cell, most of it binds to carriers
2) Circulatory system carries the unit to the target cell
3) Free messenger binds to target cell receptor and decreases [messenger]; this is a signal to cause bound messenger to dissociate

## Hormone action
Hormone concentrations are low and variable; Daily, seasonal, developmental, individual, species differences. **Level of response** depends on:
* [hormone]
* [receptor]
* receptor affinity for the hormone

Unbound hormones will end up being degraded.

## Hormone Response Termination
1. Ligand removed by distant tissue
2. Ligand taken up by adjacent cells
3. Ligand *degraded* by extracellular enzymes
4. Ligand-receptor complex removed by *endocytosis*
5. Receptor inactivation
6. Inactivation of *signal-transduction pathway*

## Feedback loops, integrated control and regulation of hormones
Secretion of hormones increased or decreased by:
* Neurotransmitters
* Neurohormones
* Other hormones
* Extracellular fluid conditions

**Feedback loop:** Changes elicit adjustment of hormone secretion
* **Negative feedback:** Inhibitory effect on secretion; dampens hormonal response, maintains constant levels
* **Positive feedback:** Stimulatory effect on secretion; allows for amplified/rapid responses
  * E.g **Oxytocin** in giving birth: Pressure on the cervix causes hypothalamus to release oxytocin & prostaglandins which makes the uterus contract

### Multiple Control Pathways: Blood Glucose
**Direct feedback loop:** pancreas secretes insulin when it senses ↑ in blood glucose
1) Glucose receptors in digestive tract → CCK (*hormone*) release →  pancreas secretes insulin 
   * 2 hormone steps, but no involvement of nervous system
2) Gut stretch receptor →  *neural* stimulation of pancreas → insulin
* Pancreas composed of α cells and β cells in islets of Langerhans; Insulin secretion (β cells) regulated by direct negative feedback loop
* **β cells:** Insulin; Decrease blood glucose (glucose uptake in target cells)
* **α cells:** Glucagon; Increase blood glucose (liver releases stored glucose)
  * Coordinated, antagonistic actions on multiple target tissues
  * Precise regulation of blood glucose by speeding up or slowing down glucose uptake into tissues or release into blood
  * Many hormones grouped into antagonistic pairs allows the endocrine system to exert extremely precise control over physiological functions

**Diabetes:**
* **Type 1 diabetes:** autoimmune destruction of beta cells
* **Type 2 diabetes:** insulin resistance in tissues
* Drugs are used that affect hormone action factors to help with Type 2 diabetes

### Case study: Regulation of blood glucose in crustaceans
CHH synthesized and secreted from neurons clustered into x-organ/sinus gland within **eyestalk**
1) Low blood glucose stimulates K+ channels to close in sinus gland cells
2) Sinus gland cell depolarizes; cells release CHH via exocytosis
3) CHH binds to receptors on target cells
4) Target cells release glucose into the blood.

## Concerted Actions affect Physiological Parameters
**Additive effects:** E.g glucagon + Epinephrine; effect is **equal** to the sum of effects of each hormone alone

**Synergistic effects:** E.g glucagon + E + cortisol; effect **greater** than the sum of effects of each hormone alone
