# Lecture 6: The Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal Complex

## The Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal complex

**Hypothalamus:** found in the forebrain (ventral location)
* Cluster of nuclei, regulates diverse homeostatic processes (body temp, appetite, thirst (water balance), reproduction, HR, BP, Circadian rhythms
* Controls pituitary secretions

**Pituitary (Hypophysis):** "Master" endocrine gland
* Anterior and posterior pituitary
* The two lobes are regulated differently (portal system vs neurosecretory tract)

**Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal Complex:** link between nervous and endocrine systems
* **Infundibulum (stalk):** links the hypothalamus to the hypophysis

### Pituitary Development
**Anterior (adenohypophysis):** derived from ectoderm of oral cavity
* **Rathke’s pouch:** separates during development; pouch filled with proliferating cells

**Posterior (neurohypophysis):** derived from neural ectoderm
* Originates from same derm layer as hypothalamus

**Neurohaemal organ:** specialized structure in which neurons contact blood vessels
* Neurons secrete neurohormones directly into blood

### Posterior Pituitary: Neurosecretory Tract
Connects *posterior* pituitary to hypothalamus.
* Posterior = extension of hypothalamus; hypothalamic neurons extend to the posterior pituitary
* **Purpose:** Secrete neurohormones into circulation
  * **Neurosecretory neurons** are synthesized in cell bodies in hypothalamic nuclei (Supraoptic and Paraventricular) and transported within vesicles along neuron
1) **Oxytocin:** Peptide hormone, induces uterine contractions and milk let-down
2) **AVP (aka ADH or vasotocin):** Peptide hormone, regulates water absorption in kidney (plus skin and/or bladder in amphibians, fish)
   * Secretion controlled by blood osmolarity and volume (ADH increases water retention)

### Anterior Pituitary: Portal System
Connects *anterior* pituitary to hypothalamus.

**Median Eminence:** No blood brain barrier
* Neurons secrete neurohormones into portal system at median eminence

**Portal system:** 2 capillary beds separated by a portal vein

**Hypophysiotropic hormones:** Releasing and inhibiting neurohormones
* Regulate secretions of hormones from anterior pituitary (done by **hypothalamus**)
* **Releasing hormones:**
1) Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)
2) Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)
3) GH-releasing hormone (GHRH/Somatocrinin)
4) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
5) Prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH)
* **Inhibiting hormones:**
1) GH-inhibiting hormone (GHIH/Somatostatin)
2) Prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH)

**Tropic hormones:** hormones that cause the release of other hormones (involved in 3rd order feedback loops)
1) **ACTH:** Regulates cortisol secretion from adrenal cortex
2) **TSH:** Regulates secretion of iodothyronines in thyroid gland
3) **FSH:** Regulates gametogenesis in gonads
4) **LH:** Regulates steroidogenesis in gonads
5) **GH:** Regulates somatomedins (IGF) secretion from liver

**Non-tropic hormones:** act directly on target tissues
6) **GH (again):** Regulates growth and metabolism in a variety of tissues
7) **Prolactin:** Milk synthesis in mammary gland; Salt/water balance at kidneys and gills in fish

**Example of Anterior Pituitary function:** 
1) Hypothalamus neurosecretory cells release Gonadotropin RH into *portal* vessels
2) Act on anterior pituitary stimulating release of gonadotropin (LH and FSH)
3) LH and FSH act on gonads to mediate steroid synthesis and release
4) Increase in Steroids (androgens and estrogens); **negative feedback** to hypothalamus

## Pituitary function and dysfunction

**Thyroid Regulation**
* **Goiter:** synthesis of TH compromised (iodine), leading to **hypothyroidism** (decrease in TH plasma levels)
  * Releases –ve feedback; ↑TRH and TSH levels, overstimulation of thyroid when it cannot produce any hormones

**Growth Hormone**
* Synthesized in somatotropic cells of the anterior pituitary
* Regulated by GHRH and GHIH which are released from hypothalamus into median eminence
* Pituitary tumor in GH-secreting cells (somatotropes)?
  * Excessive GH production leads to excessive growth
  
**Intermediate Lobe of Pituitary**
* Release **Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone** (MSH)
  * **Function:** Dispersal of pigment granules in melanophores to cause skin darkening in fish, amphibians and reptiles
    * Synthesis and dispersion of melanin in human fetus; Intermediate lobe very thin or indistinguishable in adult humans
  * Allows chromatophores in amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans, cephalopods and bacteria
  
### Integrative Function: Endocrine system and circadian rhythms
1) Light signals from retina received by Suprachiasmatic nucleus
2) Alters release of melatonin from pineal gland
3) Acts on different nuclei in hypothalamus
* Result = Circadian changes in hormone secretion
* regulates certain body functions that vary @ diff times of the day (e.g temp, hunger) or over a period of days (e.g. menstrual cycle)

## Endocrine disruption
Chemicals that interfere with endocrine function. Many endocrine disruptors mimic or block the action of natural hormones, especially steroids (many synthetic chemicals have similar structures)

Potential endocrine disruptors include:
* Pesticides (e.g. Atrazine), Insecticides (e.g. DDT) (targets estrogen)
* Bisphenol A (BPA) (plastics) (targets estrogen)
* Detergents (laundry soap, dish soap, cleaning products, etc.)
* Antibacterial soaps
* Soy products (phytoestrogen), baby formula
* **Some effects:** low sperm counts, elevated rates of diabetes, increased incidence of breast and prostate cancer, developmental abnormalities, feminization in animals (e.g fish and alligators), thin eggshells in birds, etc...

**DDT** opens sodium channels in the membrane of insect neurons and causes death
* **BUT** in mammals, DDT is (1) genotoxic and (2) acts as endocrine disruptor (antagonist of male sex hormones)

**Mechanisms of Endocrine Disruption:** Agonist, antagonist, interference with hormone synthesis/transport/degradation

**Hermaphroditic Frogs:** Atrazine induces aromatase, promoting conversion of testosterone to estrogen
* 16-20% of atrazine treated frogs had multiple gonads or were hermaphrodites (none in control)
