## Lecture 10: Introduction to Sensory Physiology
* **Sensory Physiology:** The study of how sensory stimuli are transduced by sensory receptors and processed by the nervous system
* **Sensory System:** sense organ + afferent sensory neuron + area of brain to which these neurons project
  •	E.g.: Visual system has eyes, optic nerve, brain areas concerned w/ processing visual info
* **Sense organ:** receptor cells + accessory non-neural tissues, E.g.: Eye
* **Sensory receptors:** cell that is specialized to detect incoming sensory stimuli (E.g.: rods and cones)
* **Receptor proteins:** proteins on membranes of sensory receptors (cell) specialized to detect incoming sensory signals (e.g. opsin)
* **Classification of sensory receptors:** either by location or by stimulus modality
* **Exteroceptors:** detect stimuli occurring on the outside of the body (e.g. Pressure, temperature, etc.)
* **Interoceptors:** detect stimuli occurring inside the body (e.g. Blood pressure, blood oxygen)
* **Stimulus:** form of external energy to which a receptor responds (chemo-, mechano-, photo-, thermo-, magneto-, electroreceptor)
* **Polymodal receptor:** receptors sensitive to multiple modalities (e.g. Ampullae of Lorenzini (shark nose): electricity, touch and temperature; Nociceptors (humans and other animals): detect strong stimuli of temperature, pressure, chemicals, among others; detection of pain)
* **Steps in sensory reception:** reception, transduction to electrical signal, transmission to integrating centre, perception of the stimulus at the centre
* **Types of sensory receptors:** sensory neuron or epithelial sensory receptor cell
* **Sensory neuron (sensory receptor neuron):** Is an afferent neuron; stimulus leads to a type of graded potential called “generator potential” and AP generated at trigger zone if threshold reached; goes directly into neuron
* **Epithelial sensory receptor cell:** Graded potential called: “receptor potential”; releases neurotransmitter causing graded potentials and APs in an associated primary afferent neuron; goes through second cell that has receptor protein
* **Stimulus encoding elements:** modality (type of stimulus), intensity, location, duration
### A. Encoding Stimulus Modality
* **Stimulus modality:** Most receptors are maximally sensitive to 1 type of stimulus (adequate stimulus); in general, same types of sensory receptors synapse with the same afferent neuron
* **Labeled-Line Theory:** Johannes Muller, Modality based on receptor type and afferent neuron; requires high degree of receptor specificity
* **AP Temporal Patterns:** in polymodal receptors, change the pattern of APs: “oh diff frequency so that means heat’s coming in as opposed to touch, e.g.”
* **Cross-fiber coding:** Several neurons are in close proximity with diff sensitivities and compare the relative sensitivities
### B. Encoding Stimulus Intensity
* **Stimulus Intensity:** APs are all-or-none electrical events of the same magnitude, graded (receptor/generator) potentials vary in magnitude and affect rate of APs; intensity coded through changes in frequency of APs
  -	Stim can activate 1+ receptor cells; large stim = large number of receptor cells (e.g. strong mechanical force/touch or high amplitude sound -> large deformation; how many neurons fire)
* **Dynamic range:** range of intensities over which stimuli are encoded by receptor cells
  *	Below threshold intensity, the receptor fails to initiate APs (stimulus too weak = no response)
  * Affected by: receptor protein saturation, all ion channels open/closed, membrane potential change maxes out (i.e. reaches equilibrium potential of ion), max rate of release of neurotransmitters, Maximum frequency of APs in afferent neuron (set by refractory periods, dynamic range 1000-fold)
  * Receptor A: detect broad range of stimulus intensities, but has low power to discriminate among different intensities
  * Receptor B: detect narrow range; but provide fine discrimination within that range
* **Range fractionation:** group of receptors, each sensitive to a different range, work together to provide finer discrimination across a wider range of intensities; A kicks in and is sensitive until x intensity, which kicks in B, which is sensitive until y intensity… etc.; extends the dynamic range and increases sensory discrimination
* **Logarithmic Encoding:** in some receptors, discrimination of stimulus = fine @ low intensity, coarse @ high intensity (magnitude of response plateaus); e.g. Candle light in dark room vs bright room
* **Subjective sensation:** what we think we feel; as things get brighter, it may gets brighter linearly, but we perceive it logarithmically
* **Fechner's law:** states that subjective sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity
* **Weber-Fechner relationship:** logarithmic relationship between actual and perceived stimulus intensity (e.g. brightness and weight)
### C. Encoding Stimulus Location
* **Receptive Field:** region of sensory surface that, when stimulated, generates a response in the primary afferent neuron
* **Population coding:** information about stimulus encoded in pattern of firing of multiple neurons
  -	“Neuron 7 is firing hardest while others have less so 7 is where the point of stim is mainly”
* **Lateral inhibition:** increases contrast between signals from neurons at the center of the stimulus and neurons on the edge, allowing further discrimination
* **Contrast Enhancement:** Lateral inhibition crucial for photoreceptor receptive field organization and visual processing; enhances contrast for improved detection of edges and gradients (grey square illusion/Herman grid)
### D. Encoding Stimulus Duration
* **Tonic receptors:** fire APs as long as the stimulus continues; convey information about how long the stimulus lasts
* **Receptor adaptation:** AP frequency declines even when the stimulus intensity is maintained at a constant level
* **Phasic receptors:** fire APs only when the stimulus begins (adapt quickly); convey information about changes in stimulus but not duration 
* **Pacinian Corpuscle:** Mechanoreceptor in skin, sensitive only to changes in pressure, Phasic response due to peripheral filtering from lamellae
* **Lamellae (“onion skin”):** separated with fluid act as a filter; fluid redistributes, relieving initial distortion of sensory terminal; If lamellae removed, pacinian corpuscule act more as a tonic receptor.

* **Chemoreception:** Taste, smell (olfaction), ECF composition
* **Mechanoreception:** Stretch receptors, Hearing (Audition), Balance (Proprioception), BP
* **Photoreception:** Sight and visual processing
* **Modality Similarities:** stimulus parameters encoded by AP rate and pattern
* **Modality Differences:** Highly specific transduction mechanisms
