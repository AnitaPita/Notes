# Lecture 18: Introduction to Muscles

**Lecture Objectives:**
* Understand the evolution of muscles
* Understand diversity of muscle organization
* Understand how microfilaments and tubules move things inside the cell
* Understand the specialized organization of muscle cells

## Physiological Processes involve Movement
All eukaryotic cells show intracellular movement (e.g Intracellular trafficking, movement of pigment granules)
* **melanophores**: The pigment granules that move around
* **Animals**: the only groups of multicellular organisms that are able to  move between locations
* **Myocyte:** muscle cells, are only found in animals
* **Cytoskeleton and its motor proteins:** involved in all types of movements
* **Diverse muscle types:** Differentiated by specific arrangements of cytoskeletal elements and motor proteins

## Evolution of Muscle Cells
* **Porifera (sponges):** Simplest multicellular animals lack true muscles but have **contractile cells**
* **Cnidarians (e.g *Hydra*):** First muscle-like (myoepithelial) cells
* **Ctenophores (e.g. sea walnuts and sea gooseberries):** True muscle first appeared in them; smooth muscle cells in body wall
* **SA : volume ratio: decreases** (As animals increase in size, the ratio goes down)
  * Diffusion not sufficient to  meet metabolic demands of  active lifestyles
  * Muscle diversity evolved in  conjunction with respiratory  and circulatory systems
* **Triploblastic animals**: have three germ layers (ecto-, meso-, and endoderm)
  * **Mesoderm:** Gives rise to  muscles, connective tissue and mesenteries
* **Worms:**	more elaborate muscle systems (Longitudinal and circular muscles, Protractor and Retractor muscles)
  * Circular muscle contract, coelomic  fluid pushed forward
  * Setae attach to the substrate, contraction of longitudinal muscles pulls posterior part forward
* **Squid:** complex intertwined layers of muscle fibers
  1. Radial fibers control thickness of mantle
  2. 3 layers of circular muscle control diameter of mantle
  3. Produce jet propulsion (*flying squid*)
      * Muscles **relax:** water enters internal chambers
      * Muscles **contract:** water ejected through siphon

## Vertebrate Muscle Structures
* **Striated muscles:** skeletal and cardiac muscles
  * **Sarcomeres:** give striated muscles a banded appearance
* **Smooth muscles:** line blood vessels and viscera; **not** organized into sarcomeres

## Cytoskeleton Components
* A. **Microtubules (MT)**
  * large, stiff tubes  composed of the  protein tubulin
* B. **Microfilaments (MF)**
  * MF:	small, flexible  chains of actin
* C. **Intermediate filaments**
* Only MT and MF are involved in cell mvts
* **Motor proteins:** use energy from ATP to “walk” along cytoskeleton.
  * **Kinesin and dynein:** move on microtubules
  * **Myosin:** walk along actin filaments
  
### A. Microtubules

Microtubule Assembly:
1. **Tubulin:** α-tubulin and β-tubulin protein dimers
2. Tubulin dimers form **protofilaments** (polarized)
3. Protofilaments join to form **sheets**
4. Sheets roll up to form **tubes**

* Polarity due to differences in monomers
  * α-tubulin = - end
  * β-tubulin = + end
* Balance between growth and shrinkage determines length of microtubule
  * growth at + end and shrinkage at – end
  * Affected by [tubulin], temperature, MAPs
* Maintain *constant length* by balancing growth and shrinkage

**Problems with GTP**
* GTP bound to α-tubulin is stable
* The microtubule polymerizes
* After assembly, the GTP can hydrolyze
  * GDP-tubulin in shaft stays put
  * GDP-tubulin at tip falls off
* If GTP-tubulin hydrolysis reaches the  tip the microtubule deconstructs... **CATASTROPHE**

MTs radiate from **Microtubule Organizing Centre (MTOC)** near nucleus
* -ve end towards MTOC (α)
* +ve end towards cell periphery (β)

**Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs):** Regulate MT dynamics by binding MTs: stabilizing or destabilizing them
* Link MTs together, to plasma  membrane receptors, or other  structures
* **Stable-tubule only polypeptides (STOP):** abundant in cells requiring  long stable MTs (e.g. long axons and dendrites)
* **Katanin:** a MAP that severs MTs

**Motor proteins:** mechanoproteins that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move along cytoskeletal tracks
1. **Kinesins:** Move along MTs *towards the + end* ( toward plasma  membrane)
   * e.g. Nt vesicle to synapse
2. **Dyneins:** Move *towards the – end* (toward cell body)
   * Involved in intracellular transport
   * Return empty vesicle to cell body
* Motor Proteins undergo conformational change
  * Extend head which attaches to a tubulin dimer and then bend to pull themselves along MT
    * Head region attaches to MT
    * Tail region attaches to cargo
    * Neck region connects head and tail regions
  * Fuel = **ATP Hydrolysis**
  
**Cilia and flagella have MTs**
* **Axoneme:** MT arrangement within cilia  and flagella
* **9 + 2 arrangement:** 2 single MTs in centre surrounded by 9 pairs of MTs (doublets)
* Each doublet has a series of dynein that extend toward neighbouring doublet
* **When activated:** dynein walks along neighbouring MT toward minus end
* **Wavelike (cilia) and whiplike (flagella) mvts:** generated by asymmetric activation of dyneins on opposing sides of axoneme

**Microtubule Function Overview:**
* **Cytokinesis:** Development and growth; all cells need to divide, and MTs ensure that chromosomes are equally divided after mitosis
* **Axon Structure:** In the nervous system, MTs support long axons
* **Vesicle Transport:** Hormones and cell signalling; MTs carry hormones from sites of synthesis to site of release
* **Pigment dispersion:** Adaptive coloration; MTs control the distribution of pigment granules throughout the cell to affect animal color
* **Flagellar Movement:** Reproduction; Flagella allow sperm to swim towards the egg
* **Ciliary Movement:** Respiration, digestion; cilia propel mucus and other fluids over the epithelial surface

### B. Microfilaments
Microfilaments are long polymers of **actin** protein. They are involved in vesicular transport and allow cells to change shape and move
* **Monomers:** G-actin (globular)
* Assemble to form filaments of **F-actins**
* MFs show polarization: Growth 6-10x faster at +ve end
* Capping proteins at –ve end  prevents disassembly (growth)
* **Treadmilling:** dynamic instability
* **Cross-linking proteins:** Help MFs build a network of actin filaments 

**Actin Polymerization:** can generate movement, e.g fertilization
1. Sperm encounters egg, form a bond
2. Release enzymes to break down jelly  coat
3. **Microfilament growth** on + end pushes sperm membrane through the jelly coat
4. Fuse with egg membrane
5. DNA of sperm transfers into egg

**Myosin:** Motor protein in MFs; movements are generated by interactions between MFs and myosin
* Head: ATPase, provides energy for movement
* Tail binds cargo, intracellular components or cell membrane
* Neck: regulates activity of myosin head
* Different myosin isoform classes
  * **Myosin I:** monomers
  * **Myosin V and Myosin II:** dimers
* **Myosin light chains (MLC):** proteins that associate with the neck
  * Their activity is regulated by reversible phosphorylation (MLCK (kinase),  MLCP (phophatase))
  * e.g. Myosin II (myosin heavy chains, **MHC**): associated with essential and regulatory light chains

**Actin-Myosin interactions:** 
Great myosin diversity but actin-myosin interaction mechanisms similar
* Uses Sliding Filament Model which integrates:
  1. Chemical events associated with myosin enzymatic head
     * **ATPase (myosin head):** converts energy released from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical energy
  2. Conformational changes resulting in movement
     * Myosin steps along actin filaments
* Involved in vesicular transport and in muscle contraction
* Cycles of extension, grasping, and bending to pull forward
* **Energetically costly** (especially bend and pull stage)

**Sliding Filament Model:**
1. myosin tightly bound to actin (ATP binding site empty)
2. ATP binds and myosin loses affinity for actin (cross-bridge broken)
3. Release of actin activate the myosin ATPase to convert ATP into ADP and P
4. Myosin head extends toward + end and binds to actin
5. P released and myosin use energy  stored from ATP to pull actin filament **(power stroke)**
6. ADP is released

**Actino-Myosin Movement:** Mvt depends on which of the elements (actin  or myosin) is immobilized.
* If **actin filament** fixed: myosin walks along actin filament → vesicle transport
* If **myosin** fixed (e.g. attached to membrane): actin filament moves → allows cell to change shape 
  * pulls actin filament over surface of plasma membrane
* Actin and myosin organized in 3D superstructure → muscle contraction

**Functions of Actin and Myosin**
* Actin and myosin interactions generate diverse types of  movements
* Muscle contractions involved in many physiological processes:
  * Locomotion, respiration, circulation (heart and blood vessels), digestion, secretion

## Muscle Contractile Elements
Contractile elements of all muscles are **actin and myosin polymers**
* **Thick filament:** ~300 Myosin II connected by tails with heads radiating outward
* **Thin filament:** similar to cytoskeletal MFs but composed of α-actins (instead of β-actins)
  * **Tropomodulin (- end) and  CapZ (+ end):** Stabilize thin filaments to prevent growth and shrinkage (**prevent changes in length**)
  * **Troponins and tropomyosins**:regulate contraction
  
## Types of Muscles
Organization of thin and thick filaments within myocytes distinguishes **striated** and **smooth** muscles
* **Striated muscle cells:** appear striped
  * Thin and thick filaments organized into **sarcomeres**
  * **Myofibers:** Skeletal muscle cells 
  * **Cardiomyocytes:** cardiac muscle cells 
* **Smooth muscle:** lacks striations
  * Different organization
  * **Found in:** blood vessels, respiratory tracts, visceral linings
  
### Striated Muscles

* **Sarcomere:** the contractile unit; Region between adjacent bands
  * **Myofibrils:** Organization method (interconnected sarcomeres)
* **Myofibers:** *Skeletal Muscles*, composed of many	myofibrils
  * Myofibrils run the length of muscles
  * **Multinucleated**
* **Cardiomyocytes:** *Cardiac muscles*, also composed of many myofibrils
  * ~100 sarcomeres in length (usually shorter than myofibers)
  * **Mononucleated**

**Neurogenic muscles:** stimulated to contract by *neural* activity
* Skeletal muscles innervated by motor neurons

**Myogenic muscles:**	muscle contraction generated by trigger arising from within the muscle cell
* E.g Cardiac musccle

**Cardiac vs Skeletal Muscles**
* **Cell Morphology:**
  * **Cardiac:** Single cardiomyocytes about 10-20 um in diameter and 100um in length
  * **Skeletal:** Multiple cells fused into large myofibers that are 10-100um in diameter and 1-100mm in length
* **Excitation:**
  * **Cardiac:** Myogenic and involuntary
  * **Skeletal:** Neurogenic and usually voluntary

### Striated Muscle Organization
Each thick filament surrounded by array of 6 thin filaments (in vertebrates)
* Series of myosin heads take turns pulling along the thin filaments with small, quick tugs
* **Z-disk:** protein plate forming the end of each sarcomere
* Thin filaments +ve end anchored into Z-disk by CapZ, and –ve ends directed towards center of sarcomere **(M-line)**
* Thick filaments located in center of array

**Functional Organization**
* **A-Band (Anisotropic band):** Dark region containing thick and thin filaments (overlap)
* **I-band (Isotropic band):** Lighter region of thin filaments without overlap with thick filaments
* **M-line:** Center of sarcomere, between 2 –ve ends of thin filaments
* **Structural Proteins:**
  * **Titin:** attaches thick filament to Z-disks, compressible
    * Distance between thick filaments and Z-disks changes during contraction
  * **Nebulin:** runs along length of thin filament

### Sarcomere Length and Force of Contraction
Sarcomeres shorten during contraction. Cross-bridges can only form when myosin heads can reach thin filaments. Force peaks when there is  optimal overlap between thin and thick filaments. Force ↓ with:
* decreasing overlap (over 2.5µm)
* increasing overlap of thin filaments (shorter than 2um)

**Effects on Force Production:** Amount of **Ca2+** and **Speed of contraction** matter

**WORK = Force x Distance**
* Add sarcomeres together to get greater shortening distance and therefore more work.
* Regardless of fast or slow contraction, the work is the same.

**POWER = Work/time OR Force x Velocity**
* Must balance between the contraction velocity and type of myosin. For example, Myosin I peak efficiency occurs at a lower contraction velocity than Myosin type IIb.
