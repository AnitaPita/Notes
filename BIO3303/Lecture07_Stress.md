# Lecture 7: Hormones and Stress

## Stress and the integrated stress response

**Acute stress (short term):**
* stress response: adaptation that allows an animal to respond  immediately in a generalized way to a threatening situation
* physiological responses ensure survival in an acute crisis 
  * **adaptive;** increases survival and fitness

**Chronic stress (long-term):**
* physiological responses that are adaptive in the short term  become damaging in the long term
  * **maladaptive;** decreases reproduction, survival and fitness
  
* **Stress:** physiological result of exposure to a stressor; 3 phases (Primary, secondary, tertiary)
* **Stressor:** stimulus that initiates the stress response; Abiotic or Biotic

### The three phases of the stress response
**1) Primary response – release of stress hormones (ALARM!)**
* Initiated by the hypothalamus

**2) Secondary response – metabolic, cellular and immune**
* Initiated by primary response (i.e. energy reserves mobilized, heart rate ↑, blood  oxygen transport ↑, etc.)

**3) Tertiary response – whole-animal performance**
* Follow from secondary responses (i.e. growth, reproduction and disease resistance)
* Could result in chronic stress

**Stress response variation:** Magnitude of stressor needed to elicit a response (either species-specific or individual-specific)
* Could be different hormone levels or different hormones released

### Stress Hormone Axis
**Brain-Adrenal Medulla Axis (Catecholamines)**
* Increased sympathetic outflow
* Catacholamine release from  chromaffin cells
* Immediate response, rapid and Neural
* **Primary:**
  * ↑ circulating catecholamines
  * ↑ HR and contraction
  * ↑ breathing rate
  * ↓ digestion
  * redistribution of blood flow (away from  skin and intestines)
  * vasoconstriction in skin, diverting blood  away from sites of potential injury
  * Inhibit insulin and stimulate glucagon
  * release of glucose from liver, release of FA from lipid stores
* **Secondary:**
  * Mobilize energy reserves
  * cardiovascular performance: oxygen uptake and transfer (RBC mobilization from spleen); blood flow

**Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis (Cortisol)**
* Secretion of glucocorticoid stress hormones
* Less immediate response, longer term, Neuroendochrine
* **Primary:** hypothalamus secretes CRH, anterior pituitary secretes ACTH
* **Secondary:** Long term storage role
  * **Permissiveness:** presence of one hormone is required for the other to exert an effect (cortisol enhances NE/E)

## Stress hormone mechanism of action
How can so small amount of hormone have such a huge effect?
* Catecholamines: AMPLIFICATION.
* Steroids: GENE TRANSCRIPTION.

## Stress response and the immune system
**Glucocorticoids** regulate immune function
* If bacterial infection... certain immune cells release cytokines which stimulate CRH
  * Mobilize energy stores, inhibit prostaglandins
  * **Acute stress:** Mobilize energy to fight infection, inhibit inflammation, preventing tissue damage
  * **Chronic stress:** Suppress immune function
