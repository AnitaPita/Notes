# Lecture 7: Hormones and Stress

## Stress and the integrated stress response

**Acute stress (short term):**
* stress response: adaptation that allows an animal to respond  immediately in a generalized way to a threatening situation
* physiological responses ensure survival in an acute crisis 
  * **adaptive;** increases survival and fitness

**Chronic stress (long-term):**
* physiological responses that are adaptive in the short term  become damaging in the long term
  * **maladaptive;** decreases reproduction, survival and fitness
  
* **Stress:** physiological result of exposure to a stressor; 3 phases (Primary, secondary, tertiary)
* **Stressor:** stimulus that initiates the stress response; Abiotic or Biotic

### The three phases of the stress response
**1) Primary response – release of stress hormones**
* Initiated by the hypothalamus

**2) Secondary response – metabolic, cellular and immune**
* Initiated by primary response (i.e. energy reserves mobilized, heart rate ↑, blood  oxygen transport ↑, etc.)

**3) Tertiary response – whole-animal performance**
* Follow from secondary responses (i.e. growth, reproduction and disease resistance)

**Stress response variation:** Magnitude of stressor needed to elicit a response (either species-specific or individual-specific)
* Could be different hormone levels or different hormones released

### Stress Hormone Axis
**Brain-Adrenal Medulla Axis**
* Increased sympathetic outflow
* Catacholamine release from  chromaffin cells
* Immediate response, rapid and  Neural

**Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis**
* Secretion of glucocorticoid stress hormones
* Less immediate response, longer term, Neuroendochrine
